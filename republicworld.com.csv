Jonathan Majors was convicted on December 19 of assaulting his ex-girlfriend after a trial that he hoped would vindicate him and restore his status as an emerging Hollywood star. Days after the charges, the actor had expressed a desire to work in films again. Earlier, Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Co. dropped him hours after the verdict. Now, in a new development, the actor has been replaced in another upcoming movie.

Jonathan Majors out of 48 Hours In Vegas? | Reports

Hollywood actor Jonathan Majors has lost a buzzy upcoming film role after his recent assault conviction. The actor will no longer be playing controversial basketball player Dennis Rodman in a film with the working title 48 Hours In Vegas, reports Variety. The film is set to document the true story of the Bulls’ power forward’s notorious trip to Las Vegas in the middle of the 1998 NBA finals. CNN first reported the news.

Lionsgate is also no longer involved with the project, as the studio released it back to the producers to find a new partner. As per Variety, Phil Lord, Chris Miller and Aditya Sood will produce for Lord Miller, and Ari Lubet, Will Allegra and Rodman will executive produce. Jordan VanDina is set to write the screenplay. Majors was convicted on December 18 of two misdemeanour counts of harassment and assault during a domestic dispute with his former partner, Grace Jabbari. He is set to be sentenced on February 6 and faces up to a year in jail, but he could also be sentenced to a lesser punishment, like probation. Sources close to Amazon say Majors is also no longer in discussions for the studio’s development project ‘Da Understudy’, which Spike Lee had been in early talks to direct. Marvel Studios dropped Majors from future projects on the same day as the conviction.

Why was Jonathan Majors convicted?

Jonathan Majors was arrested on March 25 on assault and harassment charges, after Grace accused him of assaulting her in the backseat of a private car after she took his phone to read a text message he had received from another woman.

She reported the star forcefully took his phone back from her, causing an ""excruciating"" injury to her right middle finger. And she said when she got out of the car Majors hit her on the back of her head and then tried to force her back into the car, causing a cut behind her right ear. Majors denied he assaulted Grace and his defense team alleged she was the aggressor when she took his phone. During the actor's nearly two-week trial, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office released a series of texts between him and Grace, as well as an audio recording that was used evidence. It was reported that Majors was set to front 2026's The Avengers: Kang Dynasty, which has now been renamed Avengers 5.

Tel Aviv: An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon hit a home in northern Israel on Sunday, resulting in the death of two civilians, as per initial reports. This incident for Israel has once again renewed fears of a second front erupting in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, which has entered its 100th day.

The conflict, triggered by Hamas' surprise attack into southern Israel on October 7, has already claimed nearly 24,000 Palestinian lives. The devastation in Gaza has forced around 85 percent of the territory's 2.3 million residents from their homes, pushing a quarter of the population into starvation.

Frontlines Heat Up: Israel, Hezbollah, and Broader Regional Fallout

Tensions in the region have escalated, with Israel engaging in almost daily exchanges of fire with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. Additionally, Iranian-backed militias have targeted US interests in Syria and Iraq, while Yemen's Houthi rebels have been attacking international shipping, prompting a series of US airstrikes.

The recent missile strike occurred a day after the Israeli army reported killing three militants attempting to infiltrate Israel. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, asserted that his group would not cease its actions until a cease-fire is established for Gaza. ""We are continuing, and our front is inflicting losses on the enemy and putting pressure on displaced people,"" Nasrallah stated, referring to the tens of thousands of Israelis who have fled northern border areas.

South Africa's Accusation of Genocide

The death and destruction in Gaza prompted South Africa to accuse Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice. Israel has denied the allegations and vowed to continue its offensive, even if the court issues an interim order to stop.

Israel has also pledged to secure the release of over 100 hostages still held in Gaza. Families of the hostages have staged protests, including a 24-hour rally in Tel Aviv that drew tens of thousands of supporters.

While Israel and Hezbollah have avoided a full-blown war on a second front, recent attacks, including the deaths of civilians on Sunday, heighten the possibility of new Israeli reprisals. Reports of heavy Israeli shelling and airstrikes in Lebanon were noted following the missile strike.

The town of Yuval, where the deadly strike occurred, had been evacuated along with more than 40 other towns along the northern border in October. However, some families, like the unfortunate victims in Yuval, remained in the area due to agricultural work.

Israeli Exodus as Southern West Bank Unrest Persists

The conflict's impact has led to the evacuation of over 115,000 Israelis from northern Israel. Tensions have also spilled into the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where nearly 350 Palestinians have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces.

In the latest incident on Sunday, the Israeli army reported opening fire after a Palestinian car breached a military roadblock in the southern West Bank, resulting in the death of two Palestinians."

Japan: A Korean Air Lines plane reportedly scraped against a Cathay Pacific Airways aircraft at New Chitose Airport on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido on Tuesday, according to Fuji TV and Reuters.

Chinese Carrier Cathay Pacific confirmed the incident involving one of its planes that was parked at the airport in Sapporo.

In a statement, Cathay Pacific stated, “Our aircraft, which was stationary at the time with no customers nor crew onboard, was struck by a Korean Air A330 which was taxiing past.”

How did the plane collide?

The Korean Air plane, carrying 289 people, reportedly hit the parked Cathay Pacific aircraft during the incident.

This incident comes merely two weeks after a collision between a Japan Airlines airliner and a coast guard plane on a runway at Tokyo's Haneda airport, highlighting recent challenges in aviation safety.

Korean Air also confirmed the incident, attributing it to a slip of the third-party ground handler vehicle during pushback due to heavy snow.

Uber shuts down Drizly: Uber has decided to shutter its alcohol delivery service, Drizly, three years after acquiring it for $1.1 billion. Despite initial plans to integrate Drizly into Uber Eats, the taxi company opted to keep Drizly operating independently until now. The discontinuation of the Drizly brand is set for March 2024.

Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, SVP of Delivery at Uber, stated, ""After three years of Drizly operating independently within the Uber family, we’ve decided to close the business and focus on our core Uber Eats strategy of helping consumers get almost anything – from food to groceries to alcohol – all on a single app.""

Advertisement

Uber expressed gratitude to the Drizly team for their contributions to the growth of the BevAlc delivery category. Drizly had faced challenges, including a data breach in 2020 affecting 2.5 million customers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had ordered Drizly to delete unnecessary personal data and implement a robust security program.

Alcohol delivery via Uber Eats

Uber now aims to concentrate on alcohol delivery through Uber Eats, where it claims to have doubled business in the category globally. Currently, Uber operates alcohol delivery through Uber Eats in 35 US states and 25 countries worldwide.

This move follows Uber's acquisition of Postmates for $2.65 billion in an all-stock deal in 2020. Additionally, Uber Eats has been enhancing its features, exploring chatbot-based options for finding restaurant deals and enabling users to order from two nearby stores simultaneously."

Gaza - The draconian militant group from Gaza, Hamas, condemned the United States for re-designating the Iran-backed Houthis as a terrorist organisation. On Wednesday, the Palestinian militant group issued a statement on the matter and called the decision “biased” and “politically motivated”. The criticism came after the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that Washington would re-classify Houthis as a terror group after the Biden administration decided to revoke the classification in 2021. Blinken mentioned that the restrictions and penalties linked to the designation would not take effect for 30 days and that the delay was designed to ensure the flow of aid and commercial goods to Yemeni civilians is minimally impacted, ABC News reported.

“Hamas strongly condemns the reclassification by Washington of the Ansar Allah movement (Houthis) in Yemen as a global terrorist organization,” the Palestinian group wrote on Telegram. ""The decision is biased and blatant support for the (Israeli) occupation and an overt attempt to protect it, providing cover for its brutal aggression and genocide against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. This unethical and biased classification once again proves the alignment of President (Joe) Biden's administration with the Zionist expansionist agenda in Palestine and the region,"" the group furthered. In the same statement, Hamas expressed appreciation and gratitude for the efforts of Houthis and insisted that “American policies” would never “free the Arab people”. “American policies will not deter the free and Arab peoples worldwide from expressing solidarity with our Palestinian people and their just cause until the end of the occupation and the realization of our people's aspirations for freedom and self-determination,” the group asserted.

Why the US re-designate Hamas as a terror group?

On Wednesday, Blinken mentioned that the US would redesignate the Yemeni militant group as a terrorist organisation. However, he noted that the restrictions and penalties linked to the designation would not take effect for the next 30 days, since the country is concerned about the flow of aid and commercial goods to Yemeni civilians. ""The Houthis must be held accountable for their actions, but it should not be at the expense of Yemeni civilians,"" Blinken said in a statement. “As the Department of State moves forward with this designation, we are taking significant steps to mitigate any adverse impacts this designation may have on the people of Yemen,” he furthered. The American diplomat also emphasised that the decision could be reversed if the rebel group ended their assault on commercial vessels. ""If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the United States will reevaluate this designation,"" he said. The US State Department revoked the designation in the group shortly after President Biden took office in early 2021."

As the world continues to grapple with a deadly pandemic, new studies found that Colorectal cancer is the deadliest cancer for men under age 50 and the second deadliest cancer among women in the same age group. Researchers believe that the incidence of Colon cancer has been rising for at least two decades when it was the fourth-leading cause of cancer death for both men and women under 50. The findings were published in the CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians on Wednesday. The cases of colorectal saw a 30% rise among adults between 50 to 64 since 1995.

The findings reflected what cancer doctors have observed for years. ""For a couple of decades now, we have been noticing that the patients coming into our clinic seem to be younger and younger,"" said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the director of the Young Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, told NBC News. ""What this report now cements for us is that these trends are real."" Ng was not involved with the new report. Meanwhile, Dr. William Dahut, the chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said younger people usually get diagnosed at later stages. ""So it's not only having colorectal cancer — it's colorectal cancer that’s more difficult to treat, which is why we’re seeing these changes in mortality,"" Dahut told the American news outlet.

What Is Colorectal Cancer?

According to the American Cancer Society, Colorectal cancer starts in the colon or the rectum. These cancers can also be called colon cancer or rectal cancer, depending on where the cancer actually starts from. It is important to note that most colorectal cancers start as a growth on the inner lining of the colon or rectum. These growths are scientifically termed as polyps. If cancer forms in a polyp, it can grow into the wall of the colon or rectum over time. The extent of the spread of colorectal cancer depends on how deeply it grows into the wall and if it has spread outside the colon or rectum.

Advertisement

Why there's a spike in cases among young adults?

According to the National Cancer Institute, experts can see a jump in colorectal cancer among young adults, due to three interrelated factors: diet, bacteria in the gut, and inflammation. Doctors believe that an unhealthy diet—in particular, one high in processed meat and fat, and low in fruits and vegetables can lead to an early onset of these cancer cases. Several scientists have also found that being overweight or obese may raise someone’s chance of getting early-onset colorectal cancer.

Meanwhile, some studies have turned their focus to bacteria that live in the gut, also called the gut microbiome. Certain types of bacteria have been pegged as accomplices in the growth and spread of colorectal cancer, and some may affect how well certain cancer treatments work. Both unhealthy diets and gut bacteria are connected in various ways. Both can lead to inflammation—the body’s reaction to injury, disease, or irritation.

What are the Symptoms?

While many people with colon cancer don't have symptoms at first, when the symptoms start appearing, it will depend on the side of the cancer. Some of the symptoms of colon cancer can include:

A change in bowel habits, such as more frequent diarrhoea or constipation.

Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool.

Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain.

A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty all the way during a bowel movement.

Weakness or tiredness.

Losing weight without trying."

KOTTAYAM, KERALA: On Thursday morning, a man from Erattupetta, Kottayam climbed up a high-voltage tower, demanding a house for his family and a meeting with the state Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and actor-politician Suresh Gopi. According to locals quoted in a PTI report, the man climbed up the tower at around six in the morning and resisted attempts by police, fire rescue personnel and panchayat officials to bring him back down.

The power supply to the tower the man had climbed was subsequently cut at around 9:30 am to ensure his safety. When fire officials attempted to bring the man down from the 80-foot tall tower, he threatened to climb higher, leading them to abandon their efforts.

Finally, six hours after he first climbed the tower, the man agreed to come down after panchayat officials assured him that his demand for a house would be addressed. At this point, the man was taken into police custody.

After coming down from the tower, the Kerala man reportedly told news channels that he had come down trusting the panchayat officials. If, however, his demand was not met, he he threatened to poison himself, his wife and his children.

""I climbed the tower intending to die. I had no other option. I saw no reason to continue living. I wanted to see the CM,"" he said

The panchayat officials reportedly told local channels that a house would be prepared for the man by March this year. In the meantime, the man and his family would be given a temporary accommodation."

Kanpur: In another incident of suicide in less than a month in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, a 29-year-old PhD student ended her life by hanging herself in her hostel room. The incident took place on Thursday, when she was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room. This is reportedly third case of suicide at the campus in a month.

The deceased student has been identified as Priyanka Jaiswal, a native of Jharkhand's Dumka. She got her admission in the month of December last year and was pursuing a PhD in Chemical engineering.

Additional DCP (West) Akash Patel, while talking to new agency PTI, said, they received information about the suicide around 1 pm. Upon reaching the spot, they found the door of Jaiswal's room was locked from inside and broke it open to find her body hanging from the ceiling fan.

Deceased Priyanka Jaiswal got her admission in December last month

A forensic team has been called to the spot, Patel said. Jaiswal's hostel mates had informed IIT-Kanpur authorities who later called the police. Possible reasons behind Jaiswal's suicide will only be revealed after a preliminary probe and completing other formalities, the DCP said.

In a statement, IIT-Kanpur said, ""With profound grief, IIT Kanpur mourns the untimely and unfortunate demise of a PhD student Priyanka Jaiswal, who joined the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Institute last month (December 2023). She was found dead in her hostel room this afternoon. "" ""A police forensic team visited the campus to review the reason for the death. The Institute is awaiting the police investigation to determine the likely cause of the death. With Ms. Priyanka's passing away, the Institute lost a bright and promising young student,"" it said.

Earlier, on January 11, Vikas Kumar Meena (31), a second-year M.Tech student of the institute, allegedly hanged himself from the ceiling fan in his hostel room, reportedly after being temporarily barred from continuing with his course.

While, on December 19, postdoctoral researcher Pallavi Chilka (34) hanged herself from the ceiling fan of her second-floor hostel room on the campus.

IndusInd Bank Q3 results: Private sector lender IndusInd Bank reported a robust 17.3 per cent increase in net profit for the third quarter, surpassing analyst estimates due to significant loan growth.

The bank disclosed a net profit of Rs 2,298 crore for the quarter ending December 31, exceeding the anticipated Rs 2,278 crore according to LSEG data.

IndusInd Bank reported a 20 per cent YoY growth in loan disbursements, coupled with a 13 per cent increase in deposits. The net interest margin, a crucial metric indicating the profitability of lending, slightly rose to 4.29 per cent compared to 4.27 per cent a year ago, remaining unchanged from the previous quarter.

Despite the consistent double-digit loan growth reported by Indian banks in recent months, rising deposit costs have exerted pressure on profit margins. Even HDFC Bank, India's leading private bank, reported weakened margins for the second consecutive quarter on Tuesday.

IndusInd Bank's net interest income, representing the difference between interest earned and paid, witnessed a substantial increase to Rs 5,296 crore from Rs 4,495 crore a year ago. Interest earned grew by 22.3 per cent, while provisions and contingencies, earmarked to cover potential loan losses, decreased by 12.3 per cent to Rs 934 crore.

GAIL's Q3 profit: GAIL Ltd, the state-owned gas utility giant, witnessed a remarkable tenfold surge in its net profit for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, showcasing strong performance across its diversified business segments, including gas transportation, marketing, and petrochemicals.

The standalone net profit for the October-December period reached Rs 2,842.62 crore, marking a significant increase from Rs 245.73 crore reported in the same quarter a year ago. This performance outpaced the preceding quarter's net profit of Rs 2,404.89 crore.

A key contributor to this financial outcome was the pre-tax earnings from the gas transportation business, which nearly tripled to Rs 1,215.07 crore. Notably, the natural gas marketing segment experienced a notable turnaround, reporting a pre-tax profit of Rs 1,880.42 crore, a significant improvement from the loss of Rs 86.02 crore in the corresponding period of 2022.

Revenue from operations

The petrochemicals business also saw a positive turn, achieving a small pre-tax profit of Rs 62 crore, compared to a loss of Rs 349 crore a year ago. Although the revenue from operations remained nearly flat at Rs 34,253.52 crore, the overall financial performance showcased the company's resilience.

For the nine-month period ending December 31, GAIL reported a 42 per cent increase in net profit, reaching Rs 6,659.51 crore on a revenue of Rs 98,303.61 crore. The surge in profits was attributed to factors such as higher gas trading margins, increased transmission volume, and a rise in transmission tariffs.

Improved physical performance

GAIL's Chairman and Managing Director, Sandeep Kumar Gupta, emphasised the improved physical performance across major business verticals during the quarter. He highlighted the profitability of the petrochemical segment, attributing it to enhanced plant efficiency, improved capacity utilisation, and optimisation measures.

GAIL's solid financial standing allowed it to declare an interim dividend of 55 per cent for the financial year 2023–24, equivalent to Rs 5.50 per equity share. Gupta also disclosed that the company invested Rs 6,583 crore in capital expenditure during the period from April 2023 to December 2023, primarily directed towards pipelines, petrochemicals, and equity contributions to joint ventures.

The company transported an average of 121.54 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas during the quarter, and gas marketing volume reached 98.14 million standard cubic metres per day. Liquid hydrocarbon sales stood at 249,000 metric tonnes, and polymer sales witnessed a notable 28 per cent increase, reaching 215,000 metric tonnes.

Haryana: In a huge setback to the INDIA bloc, Haryana state AAP Committee Chairman Ashok Tanwar and 47 others quit the party over the alliance with Congress on Thursday. Former Congress leader Ashok Tanwar joined the AAP in the presence of its supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in April 2022. Tanwar is considered to be a key Dalit face in the state who quit citing 'ethical' differences. Tanwar, who belongs to the Dalit community, was once considered to be a rising star among young Congress leaders and was considered close to Rahul Gandhi.

In a letter to AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, Tanwar wrote, ""In view of the current political scenario and your alignment with the Indian National Congress, my ethics won't allow me to continue as chairman, Election Campaign Committee, Aam Aadmi Party Haryana.""

""Therefore, kindly accept my resignation from primary membership and all other responsibilities of the Aam Aadmi Party,"" he added.

Tanwar further said that he would continue to work for the betterment of the state of Haryana, ""Bharat"" and its people.

""As a responsible citizen of this country and being into active politics since my student days, I have always believed in our Constitution, the country and its people first,"" he added.

Advertisement

Tanwar's resignation came as another setback to the AAP in Haryana as two of its senior leaders, former minister Nirmal Singh and state unit vice-president Chitra Sarwara, quit the outfit last month.

Tanwar had joined AAP in April 2022. A Dalit community leader, he had earlier been the president of the Haryana Congress.

The former Hisar MP left the Congress in 2019 following differences with former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Before joining AAP, Tanwar was briefly with the Trinamool Congress.

An easier life: Ahead of the interim budget due for being presented on February 1, announcements pertaining to job creation, affordable education and tax exemption are expected which will impact the newest crop of voters - Generation Z.

Abbreviated as Gen Z, the generation is aged in their 20s and born at the cusp of the Y2K revolution, and is known for being tech-savvy, socially conscious, and sustainable in their approach to life.

Gen Z and millennials comprised more than half, or 52 per cent of the global population in 2021, according to a NASSCOM report. This was against a global average of 47 per cent.

As the significantly high population enters the workforce amid a funding winter that triggered layoffs in the workforce, we take a look at industry expectations from policymakers for sectors that directly involve the new-gen.

Education

Founders in the education space seek relaxation on education loans and GST slabs on products and services in the category, for affordable upskilling.

Ahead of the interim Union Budget announcement, Physics Wallah (PW) co-founder Prateek Maheshwari urged for a reduction in the GST slab on educational products and services.



Maheswari, also Co-Chair of the India Edtech Consortium (IEC), said ""In view of the upcoming interim Union Budget, we would like to appeal to the government to increase the education sector’s budget, and reduce the GST slab from 18 per cent to 5 per cent on educational products and services.”



He also called for the enhancement of digital infrastructure to increase accessibility and facilitate the seamless implementation of learning solutions for children in the remotest corners of the country.



""As per the recent Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), more than half of the youths aged 14 to 18 in rural India still struggle to solve basic division problems and lack access to digital tools and skills. Bridging this gap requires a robust digital infrastructure.""



He also called for collaboration between the public and private sectors to drive a change in the sector at scale, and reducing the skillgap among jobseekers.

The present regime introduced the National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020 which introduced changes to the education system, from the inclusion of flexibility in subject choice and provisions for dual-degree.

Vaibhav Sisinty, founder of GrowthSchool called for relaxation in interest rates for education loans.

“A lot of changes have been done in the education policy, like the credit-based system - those policy changes have already happened that are propelling students in the right direction. On the budgetary level, if interest rates for loans on education can be brought down, it will really help people in levelling up and upskilling, with inflation happening at this rapid pace and the market not being so great in the macro(economic terms),” he said.

Jobs

Gen Z is interested in measures that promote job creation, skill development, and entrepreneurship.

The interim budget may see the scope of Production Linked Incentive scheme (PLI) to sectors like garments, jewellery and handicrafts, which will create more jobs and incentivise manufacturing.

""Today we have 14 sectors under the PLI scheme, but a lot of these sectors do not generate massive employment. Leather, garment, handicraft, jewellery -- many of these sectors need PLI scheme to come in because they are the ones which are the highest employment generators. That will help lower income households as well as urban,"" Deloitte India Partner Rajat Wahi told PTI.

There is also a shift towards the gig economy with a push on policies that support freelance work and more flexible work arrangements.

Taxation

With a rising cost of housing posing concern for young people, the Gen Z will look forward to measures for affordable housing and finance measures.

Notably, over 30 approvals are required from state and union government authorities for a real estate project.

A single-window clearance system for simplifying the bureaucratic process will result in earlier project approvals, lesser delays and enhancing the overall efficiency of projects to enable more housing for all.

Experts also expect relaxation on tax slabs, with the limit in rebate likely to be increased to at least Rs 7 lakhs."

Talking about the situation in the Red Sea and Iran the spokesperson shared Indian concern over the situation. He said, ""This issue of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the violence there and the destabilized nature of things there were discussed. We are deeply concerned about the whole situation.

But at the same time, we have the Indian Navy, which is patrolling the area. They're trying to secure the sea lanes and do their best so that our economic interests are not impacted.”

The United States and the United Kingdom carried out strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen, after the group repeatedly attacked ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group which considers Israel an enemy, started firing drones and missiles towards Israel, following the start of the war in the Gaza Strip.

Not only this, on 19 November, the Houthis hijacked a commercial ship in the Red Sea and have since attacked more than two dozen others with drones, missiles and speed boats. The US-led naval forces thwarted many of the attacks.

Manchester City are set to take on Inter Milan in the highly-awaited Champions League final in Istanbul. The English champions have already secured a double with both Premier League and FA Cup in their kitty and they are on the verge of recording a continental treble. It remains to be seen whether the underdog tag could work in the favour of Inter who will be gunning for a fourth Champions League crown.

Can 2009's FC Barcelona be compared with the current Manchester City side?

Comparisons will definitely be drawn between Pep Guardiola's Barcelona and the current Man City team if the English champions manage to do the treble this time but former Barcelona footballer Jofre Mateu rejected the opinion. In a media interaction, he told republicworld.com, ""Not now. Depending on the title at the end of Pep Guardiola’s era. I think it’s tough to compare you know because it’s not only about Guardiola and football’s evolution and different players.

""That time Barcelona had the superiority because it was new. But these days Manchester City have not played something new. Ball possession, high pressure which is copied from that Barcelona team.""

Jofre, who also had successful stints in the Indian Super League with clubs like FC Goa, further added, ""The players are so different. The wings are playing, close to the lines but they are not going one by one very often. Finishing on the line. Kevin De Bruyne with movements, John Stones playing inside""

""So the idea is to keep the ball and be very high. Of course, in these aspects you can compare but the rest are very different. Again Guardiola’s idea is the same. But because of the context, all the rest are very different.""

Who will emerge as a pivotal player in the UCL final

On paper, City have some decorated names under their folds with the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Erling Haaland and Ilkay Gundogan who could change the landscape of UCL Final on their own. But former Premier League footballer Ashley Westwood reveals Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella could play a major role if the Italian side is to grind out something from this eventful clash.

""He is going to be crucial because he will be asked to defend. He could be picking up Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin De Bruyne in the number 10 positions. he will also be competing against Rodri and John Stones for that second ball. He is going to have to be all over the pitch. He has to cover each and every blade of grass. We have seen him score. He is going to have to get into the box.

""You will expect Eden Dzeko, Lautaro Martinez and the opposite wingbacks to be in the box and it means you have to get in another midfielder in the box. So Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Hakan Çalhanoğlu and Barella at times need to be in that box to put pressure on Manchester City.

""So Barella is going to be important and he has played a lot against good clubs. He is capable, fast, athletic, and tenacious and he is going to play the game of his life if he is to have an impact in the Champions League final,"" he signed off.

India job crisis: Thousands of Indian labourers, including masons, painters, electricians, and plumbers, lined up for a recruitment drive in Haryana yesterday, January 17, seeking construction jobs in Israel, news agency Reuters reported. The ongoing conflict in Gaza, now in its fourth month, has created a labour shortage in the Jewish state, presenting an opportunity for Indian workers eager for higher wages despite the security risks.

Driven by high unemployment in India, particularly among young adults, workers are willing to risk the conflict zone for the chance to earn up to five times their salaries in India. As Lekharam, a mason at the Rohtak recruitment camp, put it, ""If it's in our destiny to die, then we can die either here or there. I hope that we will go and do good work and spend some time and come back.""

Advertisement

Both the Israeli embassy in New Delhi and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the recruitment drive.

This demand aligns with Israel's need for foreign workers. Following a Hamas attack in October, the construction sector has stalled, prompting plans to bring in 70,000 workers from China, India, and other countries. The National Skills Development Corporation of India has also been actively exploring labor opportunities in Israel.

While recruiters at the camp remained tight-lipped, 28-year-old mason Vivek Sharma openly acknowledged the conflict but prioritised the potential financial gains. ""Yes, I am aware of the conflict, but I can earn a lot of money in a short time,"" he said, estimating a potential annual income of over $12,000 in Israel compared to years of effort to earn the same amount back home.

This recruitment drive exemplifies the growing trend of Indian workers seeking overseas opportunities, with government data showing 13 million Indian nationals currently working abroad. Last year's agreement between India and Israel to allocate over 40,000 Indian workers for nursing and construction sectors further underlines this emerging collaboration.

He even sent out invitation cards for the 13th-day (tervi) ceremony and made Brahmins conduct rituals and havan.

Feeling disheartened by what he perceived as his brothers' and nephews' alleged indifference towards him while he was alive, Yadav suspected that they might neglect the proper execution of his death rituals.

Components for military: Despite international sanctions, Western companies supplied Russia with $2.9 billion worth of components potentially applicable for military production in the first 10 months of 2023, according to Ukraine's president's office. The revelation comes amid Ukraine's calls for stricter sanctions and export control measures against Russia. The imports of military goods by Russia in 2023 reached 90 per cent of pre-invasion levels, raising concerns about the effectiveness of existing sanctions.

Research results

Research conducted by a working group led by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, and former US ambassador Michael McFaul highlighted the use of products from over 250 Western companies in Russian weapons, identified through samples from captured or destroyed equipment. The Kyiv School of Economics, involved in the research, found nearly 2,800 foreign components, including those from US-based firms, in Russian military equipment, such as the hypersonic ""Kinzhal"" missiles used in air strikes against Ukraine.

The study emphasised that 95 per cent of the parts discovered in Russian weapons on the battlefield originated from coalition countries, with 72 per cent sourced from US-based companies alone. This information raises questions about the efficacy of export control measures and the need for more stringent sanctions against entities facilitating military-related trade with Russia.

Russia has not provided an immediate response to the allegations made by Zelenskiy's office. The findings underscore the challenges in preventing the flow of critical components to Russia despite existing sanctions, urging a reevaluation of international efforts to curtail Moscow's military capabilities.

NEW DELHI: On Thursday, police officials said that two men had been arrested from Bihar for allegedly defrauding a senior retired government official from East Delhi of Rs 41,000 by way of an online scam. The accused, Sachin Jha (27) and Mohammad Sakib (23) hail from Bihar's Patna and Aurangabad respectively.

According to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Achin Garg, the arrests were made in connection with a complaint made to the cyber cell of the east district by a senior retired government official. The ex-official had claimed that, during the course of making a credit card repayment, he had clicked on a suspicious-looking payment link he had received on his email ID. When he clicked the link, an amount of Rs 41,000 was automatically deducted from his pension account.

According to a police official quoted in a PTI report, the authorities followed the money trail to an HDFC account in Darbhanga, Bihar registered to one Tribhuvan Sinha from Patna. The money itself was withdrawn from said account from an ATM in Kolkata.

When Sinha was eventually apprehended and interrogated, he revealed that he had not opened an HDFC account. However, he did say that one Sachin Jha had taken his Aadhar Card and PAN Card seven months ago on the pretext of helping him secure a bank loan.

Advertisement

This led to Jha being apprehended and several mobile phones, chequebooks, passbooks, SIM cards, debit cards, laptops and stamps were recovered from his possession.

Jha revealed to the police that after opening an account in Sinha's name, he had sold the account to an individual known as Shakib who then re-sold it to one Riyaz in Kolkata. It was allegedly Riyaz who had generated the false link which was used to siphon money away from the retired government official's pension account.

Teams have now been reportedly formed to nab this Riyaz from Kolkata."

Ayodhya: With only four days left for the historic ‘Pran Pratistha’ at Ayodhya’s Ram Temple, the youngest karsevak during the Ram Janmabhoomi Movement shared his memories exclusively to Republic TV. Lokendra Singh, a resident of Rajasthan’s Uniara, was just 9 when the Ram Janmabhoomi Movement erupted in Ayodhya in December 1992. He recounted the time, when he along with his father had joined the movement in 1992.

Speaking exclusively to Republic TV, Lokendra Singh, also known as, Lokesh stated that he was just 9, when he along with his father Balbhadra Singh Naruka had reached Ayodhya in Kar Seva on December 6, 1992.

Recalling his childhood days at Sangh, he said that he used to go to the Sangh office on a regular basis. He used to read Sangh’s newspaper and therefore was very much aware of the Ram Mandir Movement. After reading news related to the movement, a feeling to join the movement arose in his heart.

Lokendra highlighted that he used to listen to cassettes of speeches of prominent leaders of ‘Ram Mandir Andolan’ including that of Ashok Singhal, Sadhvi Ritambhara, and Acharya Dharmendra Maharaj. He added that it was during the time, when a religious meeting of Acharya Dharmendra Maharaj was held at Uniara and he got to hear him during the meeting. Ever since, then the atmosphere of the Ram Mandir movement impacted his mind.

Lokesh said that it was when his father Balbhadra Singh Naruka along with his friends Babulal Jain and Ghanshyam Sharma were getting ready to head to Ayodhya. He too insisted and joined them to go to Ayodhya.

All the karsevaks and a huge crowd of the people had gathered in the temple of Charbhuja ji before heading for Ayodhya, he stated, adding that his memories are still alive, when he went to seek his mother’s blessings before leaving for Ayodhya and the way she happily agreed to permit him for the same.

Lokesh, however, asserted that his father was not willing to take him along citing the threatening situation prevailing in Ayodhya during the movement. His father warned him several times, but later agreed to take him to Ayodhya seeing his determination.

Lokesh recounted saying that as he reached Ayodhya on December 2, he was the youngest Karsevak in that group.

Atletico Madrid got the better of Real Madrid this time, beating its crosstown rival 4-2 in extra time Thursday to reach the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey.

Antoine Griezmann and Rodrigo Riquelme scored after a 2-2 draw in regulation to send Atletico to the last eight less than a week after it lost to Madrid in the semifinals of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Advertisement

Atletico thrived again at home, where it also beat Madrid in the first Spanish league derby of the season in September in what had been its rival’s only loss this season. Atletico is unbeaten in 25 consecutive matches at its Metropolitano stadium in all competitions, with two draws since a 1-0 league defeat to Barcelona in January 2023.

Defending champion Madrid eliminated Atletico in the Copa quarterfinals last season, winning 3-1 in extra time at home. The city rivals will play again on Feb. 4 — the third meeting in less than a month — in the Spanish league at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium. Madrid won 5-3 in extra time in the Super Cup semifinals last Wednesday.

Griezmann secured Atletico’s win this time with a beautiful goal after making a run through the right side of the area. The France international, Atletico’s all-time top scorer with 175 goals, got past Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior before finding the top corner from a tight angle.

“It was an amazing goal, probably one of his best,” Madrid coach Diego Simeone said. “We played a very good match and the players gave everything they had against a top opponent. It was a great match.”

Advertisement

Riquelme sealed Atletico’s win from inside the area on a breakaway in the 119th after an assist by Memphis Depay.

Atletico had opened the scoring with a goal from close range by Samuel Lino after Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger deflected the ball backward into the area in the 39th. Madrid equalized after a rare mistake by Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who punched the ball into his own net while trying to clear a cross.

Advertisement

Álvaro Morata put Atletico ahead again from close range in the 57th after Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin failed to fully clear a cross. The ball bounced off Rüdiger and went toward Morata in front of an open net.

Striker Joselu, who came on for Rodrygo in the 80th, equalized with a header in the 82nd after a cross by Jude Bellingham. Morata had missed a clear chance in a one-on-one situation with Lunin just moments earlier.

Advertisement

Brahim Díaz thought he had scored an equalizer late in extra time but the goal was disallowed because of an offside by Bellingham.

Bellingham hit the crossbar early in the first half, and Rodrygo struck the woodwork in the second.

Madrid went on to win the Spanish Super Cup 4-1 in the final against Barcelona on Sunday, but there was no guard of honor by Atletico before the match at the Metropolitano.

There was a report by The Athletic and some Spanish media that some Atletico fans called Vinícius a monkey before the game. The Brazil international had been racially abused by Atletico fans before other derbies, including by some who hanged an effigy of the player off a highway bridge last year.

Advertisement

Simeone exchanged a few heated words with Vinícius after the end of regulation. The coach appeared to be upset with Vinícius because of his celebration after Joselu’s goal. Vinícius apparently also got into a spat with one of the ball boys at the Metropolitano.

“It was a very competitive match, he was involved in many duels, and sometimes you are not able to keep your cool,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said about Vinícius. “I think it’s understandable.”

Ancelotti’s Madrid had come into the game on an unbeaten run of 21 matches in all competitions, with 17 wins and four draws.

BARCELONA ADVANCES

Barcelona picked up the pace in the second half to beat third-division club Unionistas 3-1 in its round-of-16 match.

It will be the second straight last-eight appearance for the Catalan club, which arrived under pressure after losing the Spanish Super Cup final to Madrid.

Advertisement

After being held 1-1 at halftime, Barcelona improved in the second half to secure the victory with goals by Jules Koundé and Alejandro Balde.

The hosts had taken the lead with a beautiful one-timer by Álvaro Gómez in the 31st minute before Ferran Torres equalized for Barcelona on a breakaway in the 45th. Koundé scored with a long-range shot in the 69th and Balde sealed the victory with a strike from a tight angle in the 73rd.

Advertisement

“After a tough loss in the Super Cup we needed to rebound,” Koundé said. “It wasn’t easy, they have a good team and were very motivated.”

Unionistas had a few chances to move closer toward the end, but Barcelona goalkeeper Iñaki Peña made some good saves to maintain the comfortable lead at the 5,000-capacity Reina Sofia Stadium.

Mohamed Salah had to go off injured toward the first half of Egypt’s Africa Cup of Nations game against Ghana on Thursday.

The Liverpool star pulled up shortly before halftime, sat on the field, then indicated he couldn’t continue when the team’s medical staff went to treat him. He seemed to hold the back of his left thigh.

Dollar to rise: The Dollar is set for its second consecutive weekly gain as signs of resilience in the US economy and a cautious stance on rate cuts from central bankers influence market sentiment.

The Australian and New Zealand Dollars are on track for their largest weekly gains since November and June, rising by 1.7 per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively.

The market's probability of a US rate cut in March has decreased from 75 per cent to 57 per cent over the week.

The Dollar index has risen by 0.9 per cent to 103.4, with the Dollar gaining nearly 5 per cent against the Japanese yen this year, casting doubt on expectations of a Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hike.

Japan's core inflation slowed to 2.3 per cent in December, the lowest annual pace since June 2022, supporting the belief that BOJ rate hikes may not be imminent.

Rabobank strategist Jane Foley noted the market's realisation of the challenges for the BOJ in raising rates and the concurrent reevaluation of Fed rate cut risks, contributing to the Dollar's strength against the yen.

Rabobank revised its one-month forecast for Dollar/Yen to 148 from 144.

In the Asia session, currency movements were modest, with the Euro down 0.7 per cent for the week at $1.0878 and sterling down 0.3 per cent to $1.2708.

The Aussie saw a slight boost from stabilising iron ore prices, rising 0.1 per cent to $0.6578, while the kiwi remained steady at $0.6118.

Strong US labour-market data, with weekly jobless claims at their lowest in nearly 1-1/2 years, added pressure on market rate-cut expectations.

Advertisement

Two-year Treasury yields, reflecting short-term interest rate expectations, rose 22 basis points to 4.3587 per cent this week. Retail sales in December exceeded expectations.

Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller's comments stressed upon the US economy's strength, suggesting a cautious and gradual approach to any rate adjustments. Similarly, a hawkish tone from European central bankers tempered expectations for rate cuts in Europe, limiting the euro's decline against the Dollar and boosting crosses like euro/yen and euro/swissy.

Unexpectedly high British inflation led to a pullback in bets on Bank of England rate cuts, providing support for the pound.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit a five-week low at $40,484, as profit-taking ensued following the US approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

Speculators had driven the price 150 per cent higher in 2023, anticipating increased cryptocurrency investment by large-scale investors after regulatory approval.

HanuMan starring Teja Sajja and directed by Prasanth Varma is running successfully in theatres despite opening to a lukewarm response at the box office. The film which hit theatres on January 12 has been receiving positive reviews from audiences and critics alike for its visual effects, storyline, and much more. Following the good responses, the film is now inching closer to ₹100 crore at the domestic box office.

HanuMan emerges as a success among other Sankranti releases

Teja Sajja's HanuMan clashed with Mahesh Babu's Guntur Kaaram and other Tamil films at the box office. The film gave a tough competition to other Sankranti releases and turned out to be a sleeper hit at the box office. HanuMan earned ₹100 crore in just four days despite having a limited release across the world. Due to good word of mouth, theatres are reportedly planning to add more shows for HanuMan.

Merry Christmas hit the big screens on January 12 coinciding with the Sankranti holiday. The film is headlined by Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi and is directed by Sriram Raghavan. Despite having no other significant release in Bollywood, the film has failed to leave a lasting impression at the box office.

Merry Christmas sees a steep decline at the box office

Merry Christmas opened to a decent ₹2.45 crore on its first day and saw an upward trend in business on the weekends. However, ever since the film has seen a decline at the box office. After a seven-day theatrical run, the movie has amassed a total of ₹14.87 crore.

On the seventh day of release, the film’s first Thursday, Merry Christmas raked in a mere ₹1.05 crore, as per early estimates provided by Sacnilk. It must be noted that the film’s release coincided with the Makar Sankranti holiday and did not face any stiff competition from other releases in Bollywood. However, the movie did have to deter competition from South releases like HanuMan and Captain Miller, which were also released in Hindi.

However, since the film is getting a good word-of-mouth, it may pick up pace in its 2nd weekend especially in the urban centres.

All About Merry Christmas

The Sriram Raghavan film was initially scheduled to release on December 12. However, after the makers of Prabhas starrer Salaar decided to release the film on December 22, the Katrina Kaif-Vijay Sethupathi starrer was pushed to January 12.

Merry Christmas is produced by Ramesh S. Taurani under the production banner of Tips Productions. The film was shot and released in Hindi and Tamil languages. The film is shot in two languages, with different supporting actors. The Hindi version co-stars Sanjay Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Pratima Kannan, and Tinnu Anand, while the Tamil version has Radhika Sarathkumar, Shanmugaraja, Kevin Jay Babu, and Rajesh Williams in the same roles. It marks the Tamil debut of both Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi.

Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka reached the fourth round of the Australian Open on Friday with a 6-0, 6-0 demolition of Lesia Tsurenko.

The second-seeded Belarusian, who won her first Grand Slam title here 12 months ago, needed just 52 minutes for victory at the Rod Laver Arena. She has dropped just six games in three rounds so far.

“Last year, Iga (Swiatek) won so many sets 6-0 and this is one of the goals, to try to get closer to her,” Sabalenka joked. “I’m just super-happy with the level I’m playing so far. Hopefully I can just keep going like that or even better.""

The pair did not shake hands — as is the convention for Ukrainian players against opponents from Russia or Belarus — but Tsurenko congratulated Sabalenka verbally.

Sabalenka will play Amanda Anisimova, who continued her comeback with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Paula Badosa. Anisimova, who took seven months out of the game last year for mental health reasons, hit 40 winners on her way to the fourth round.

“It’s quite unbelievable,” the American said. “For sure taking a step away from the game ... gave me a new perspective. I’m trying to be in the present. I think in the past I was getting too caught up in the past and the future.”

Sabalenka said she expects a tough battle against Anisimova, who has won four of their five matches.

“She’s an incredible player and I’m really happy to see her back,” Sabalenka said.

Josh Hazlewood claimed his 11th five-wicket total in test matches as Australia completed a 10-wicket win over West Indies on Friday before lunch on the third day of the first test.

Australia dismissed the West Indies for 120 in the 13th over of the day on Friday, leaving the home side needing just 26 runs to win.

Steve Smith (11) and Usman Khawaja (9) easily completed that total for Australia, although Khawaja retired hurt after being hit by a bouncer with Australia needing one run to win. Marnus Labuschagne hit the winning run two balls later.

Hazlewood already had 4-18 at the start of the day as he helped Australia reduce the West Indies to 73-6 in its second innings before stumps on the second day. Australia led by 95 runs on the first innings after making 283 in reply to the West Indies 188.

The big question at the start of the day was whether the West Indies would be able to make Australia bat again. It began to look unlikely when Mitchell Starc dismissed Joshua da Silva (18) and Alzarri Joseph (16) and Hazlewood bowled Gudakesh Motie (3) to leave the West Indies 94-9, still needing one run to avoid an innings defeat.

Shamar Joseph and Kemar Roche again produced a small rearguard action, adding 26 for the last wicket after putting on 55 for the last wicket in the first innings. Joseph already was a star of the match for his 36 in the first innings and his 5-94 on debut.

He hit three boundaries on Friday to add a little to the West Indies lead before he was the last man out.

A smile creased Daniil Medvedev's face as he walked to the net in Rod Laver Arena at 3:39 a.m. , finally a winner in the Australian Open's second round after five sets spread across nearly 4 1/2 hours in the third-latest finish in Grand Slam history.

Zero chance Medvedev would have been there at that time if he didn't need to be. If he were one of the spectators in the nearly empty stands, and a match stretched past, say, 1 a.m., the 2021 U.S. Open champion said, “I would be like, ‘OK, let’s go home. We’re going to catch the end of the match on the TV. Going to watch 30 minutes, then go to bed.’”

Advertisement

So why were Medvedev, a two-time runner-up at Melbourne Park, and the man he beat 3-6, 6-7 (1), 6-4, 7-6 (1), 6-0 in a match that began there Thursday and concluded Friday, Emil Ruusuvuori ... and the chair umpire ... and the ball people ... and the (few) spectators who remained still awake so late?

That's not the sort of thing that happens in other sports.

Advertisement

“No one should be playing tennis at 330am. This is looney tunes,” was a sentiment expressed by John Isner on social media and surely shared by others. Isner, of course, knows a thing or two about playing forever: He won the longest match in tennis history, an 11-hour, 5-minute marathon spread over three days at Wimbledon in 2010.

First of all, there's no such thing as a “game clock” in tennis, in general, and no such thing as “too late” at the Australian Open and U.S. Open, in particular. They play night sessions at those two Grand Slam tournaments, and have for decades, and if the start of one match happens to be delayed until 10 p.m. or even later — Medvedev and Ruusuvuori began warming up after 11 p.m. — they keep playing until someone wins.

Advertisement

In this case, they were pushed back because the match that preceded theirs — Anna Blinkova's upset of 2022 Wimbledon champion and 2023 Australian Open finalist Elena Rybakina — lasted more than 2 1/2 hours and included a record-setting 22-20 tiebreaker .

It was also a day of ripple effects, because only eight of the 32 singles matches, including one of 16 in the men's bracket, were done in straight sets (which is two sets for women, who play a maximum of three, and three sets for men, who play a maximum of five).

Advertisement

At Wimbledon, the All England Club has an agreement with local residents to halt play at 11 p.m.

Night sessions at the French Open only began in 2021, and while there was a memorable quarterfinal the following year between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic that ended after 1 a.m. — “TV decides. That’s the world we are living in,” Djokovic keenly observed about the late start of that one — it's yet to have the sort of bleary-eyed finishes that Melbourne and New York produce semi-regularly.

Advertisement

The four latest Grand Slam finishes happened in Australia — 4:34 a.m. is the record, for a 2008 match between Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis — and No. 5 came at the U.S. Open, a 2022 victory for Carlos Alcaraz over Jannik Sinner that wrapped up at 2:50 a.m.

Not really.

Advertisement

“If we’re going to be honest with ourselves, what are people are looking for? They’re not looking for five-hour matches. … I’ve haven’t been able to sit through one,” two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka said. “It’s just too long.”

Andy Murray, owner of three Grand Slam titles, won a match that stretched beyond 4 a.m. at Melbourne a year ago and is certain that makes zero sense.

Advertisement

“It’s a very obvious thing that needs to change. I haven’t heard anyone really disagree with that,” Murray said.

“Just probably looks a wee bit more professional,” he added, “if you’re not finishing at 3, 4 in the morning.”

Advertisement

Not to mention what it does for the well-being of the athletes and the quality of the competition — during that match and subsequent ones. Both Medvedev and Ruusuvuori were treated by trainers. Medvedev got some help from the chair umpire while tying his shoe at one point. The fifth set was lopsided and not all that entertaining.

“Yes, at night is probably our prime time and we can optimize viewers,” reigning U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff said, “but also, we have to protect the players’ health.""

Advertisement

The women's and men's professional tours announced just before the start of the Australian Open that they're instituting new rules this month to try to cut back on play after midnight. One problem: Those rules apply only to events run by the WTA and ATP — not Grand Slam tournaments.

Medvedev posted a photo of his watch at nearly 4:30 a.m. with the caption, “It's late!” and a laughing-crying emoji. He figured he wouldn't be getting to sleep until about 6 or 6:30 a.m. on Friday, which wasn’t ideal given he will be scheduled to play again Saturday, against Felix Auger-Aliassime.

“I will try to give my everything,” Medvedev said. “If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.”

If he wasn’t on the court competing, Daniil Medvedev doubted anything would have kept him at Rod Laver Arena until almost 4 in the morning.

The third-seeded Medvedev lost the first two sets of his second-round Australian Open match against No. 53-ranked Emil Ruusuvuori before coming back to win 3-6, 6-7 (1), 6-4, 7-6 (1), 6-0 in 4 hours, 23 minutes in the latest finish of the week.

Advertisement

They’d walked onto Rod Laver Arena to start hitting at 11:07 p.m. Thursday after women’s No. 3 Elena Rybakina lost the longest tiebreaker ever in a women’s Grand Slam event, 22-20 to Anna Blinkova.

The match ended at 3:39 a.m. Friday, and Medvedev was still there signing autographs as the clock ticked closer to 4.

Advertisement

The long tiebreaker and the uncertainty over the starting time, he said, meant his eating and warming up routines were thrown out of kilter.

“When I went on court I was a little exhausted already,” Medvedev, a two-time Australian Open finalist, explained to the scattering of fans still in the arena well after the last trams had finished running for Day 5.

Advertisement

It won’t go down as a classic, but still had plenty of drama.

Medvedev needed a medical timeout for blisters on his right foot after the second set, and he spiked his racket into the court after missing a chance to break Ruusuvuori’s serve late in the fourth.

Advertisement

Then he had trouble tying the laces of his right shoe right before the deciding fifth set.

Looking at the clock, he was frank with the people who’d stayed there until a couple of hours before the sun was due to rise.

Advertisement

“Honestly guys, I would not be here,” Medvedev said in an on-court interview. “Thanks for staying. If I would be a tennis fan and I would come, at 1 a.m. I would be like ‘OK, let’s go home. We’re going to catch the end of the match on the TV.’”

It was the latest finish so far this year, but not close to the tournament record. Andy Murray finished off Thanasi Kokkinakis just after 4 a.m. last year in a second-round match that lasted 5 hours, 45 minutes.

Advertisement

And that was only good enough for second place on the all-time list. The latest-finishing match in Grand Slam history ended with Lleyton Hewitt beating Marcos Baghdatis at 4:34 a.m. in 2008.

After player complaints last year, Australian Open organizers decided to extend the tournament by adding a 15th day and starting on a Sunday for the first time.

Advertisement

The first round was split over three days, and no matches went past 2 a.m.

But the first day of the second round was entirely different story, with two early men’s matches going to a decisive tiebreaker after five sets and top-ranked Iga Swiatek’s opener against Danielle Collins going for almost 3 1/4 hours.

Advertisement

And so Day 5 of the Australian Open finished on a Friday, anyway.

Medvedev said he’d have to warm down, get some physiotherapy and try to get to sleep by 6:30 a.m. and wake up some time after midday to start preparing for his third-round match against Felix Auger-Aliassime.

Advertisement

Ruusuvurori, a 24-year-old from Finland who was aiming to reach the third round for the first time at a major, started well.

He broke the 2021 U.S. Open champion’s serve in the second game and took the first set in 42 minutes. It took almost twice that long to take the second set in a tiebreaker for a 2-0 lead.

Advertisement

After a medical timeout, Medvedev started his comeback. He broke for a 2-1 lead and, after an exchange of breaks, he took the third set in 49 minutes.

He also broke to open the fourth. But Ruusuvurori broke back, converting with a leaping overhead, to get back on serve and had Medvedev screaming toward his support team in the stands.

Advertisement

He held for a 5-4 lead with a couple of forehand passing shots, and Medvedev hurled his racket into the court before he walked to the chairs for the changeover. It earned him a warning from the chair umpire.

At deuce in the next game, Ruusuvuori was two points from winning the match at 2:56 a.m.

But he stepped in to a service return and missed a forehand wide down the line, and then sent a forehand long.

Advertisement

After all that, the end came relatively quickly.

Medvedev took a 4-0 lead in the tiebreaker, seizing momentum.

Advertisement

After an almost eight-minute break between the fourth and fifth sets, Medvedev’s experience kicked in and Ruusuvuori’s legs gave out.

The 30-minute deciding set was only prolonged by Ruusuvuori taking a medical timeout for treatment on his sore right shoulder.

Advertisement

“The only two matches I’ve come back from two sets to love down was on this court,” Medvedev said.

Going into the match he was 4-10 in five-setters, including a loss to Rafael Nadal in the 2022 final after he’d taken the first two sets.

“This one,” he said, “is going to for sure stay in my memory.”"

New Delhi: After stoking controversy and questioning the January 22 ‘Pran Pratishthqa’ ceremony, Congress leader Udit Raj has yet again attacked the enthusiasm and jubilation surrounding the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony. With the Centre announcing half holiday for all central government offices and states like Assam, Odisha, Rajasthan and Tripura following suit, and Uttar Pradesh announcing public holiday too, INDI leader Udit Raj has questioned as to why public holiday is being announced on January 22 over the Ram Mandir opening.

“India is a secular country and according to the constitution, there should not be a holiday for one religion. Our country has not yet become a Hindu nation. They (central government) are trying to declare this country as a Hindu nation,” Udit Raj alleged.

“Dr BR Ambedkar had said that if India becomes a Hindu rashtra, it will bring with it destruction. I think this is the beginning of destruction,” Udit Raj further claimed.

Responding to Udit Raj’s comment, Kameshwar said, “INDI alliance is rejecting the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony invitation.”

After various leaders of the INDI alliance took turns to attack the holy event, now Congress' Udit Raj has criticised the consecration ceremony, calling it a dark time (Kalyug) for Dalits and tribal communities. “After January 22, Kalyug of Dalits, tribals and backward people is going to start!,” Udit Raj posted on X.

Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha: Five hundred kilograms of ‘kumkum’ leaves have been sent from Amravati in Maharashtra to Ayodhya for the pran pratishtha ceremony of the Ram Mandir scheduled for Ayodhya for January 22. Kumkum leaves carry profound social and religious significance in India especially in Hindu culture.

Spiritual leaders Rajeshwar Mauli and Jitendranath Maharaj took the ‘kumkum’ leaves to the holy town of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. The function to mark their departure to Ayodhya on Thursday was attended by local MP Navneet Rana in Maharashtra.

His involvement expanded the film's reach, allowing for a wide theatrical release. Lokesh proactively engaged in promotional efforts, conducting interviews to generate awareness about the movie.

Vijay Kumar's career trajectory and impact

Vijay Kumar, the driving force behind Fight Club, gained recognition through his debut in Uriyadi (2016), directing, producing, and starring in the film, receiving acclaim from both critics and audiences. He replicated this success with the 2019 sequel, Uriyadi 2, which achieved significant success at the box office.

Cost-conscious consumers: Australian consumers are increasingly adopting a cautious spending approach, choosing to make purchases primarily when attractive bargains are available. This shift in consumer behaviour comes in response to the ongoing financial pressures stemming from high home loan payments and the escalating cost of living, as indicated by data from Westpac.

Dining, travel decline

The Westpac Card Tracker Index, registering at 137.2 for the week ending Jan. 13, reflects a 3-point increase from mid-December. However, the quarterly analysis shows a decrease in spending, particularly in sectors such as travel and dining out. The index, with a base of 100 reflecting average 2019 activity, suggests a fluctuating pattern during the Christmas-New Year period, signifying consumers actively seeking discounts to address the challenges posed by the cost of living.



Matthew Hassan, a senior economist at Westpac, highlighted, ""The Christmas-New Year period has been a sporadic one for consumer-related card activity with bursts around key sales weeks followed by sharp pull-backs."" This observation aligns with the broader trend of consumers strategically seeking out discounts amidst economic pressures.

Black Friday boost

In a separate report, ANZ data revealed a notable seasonal increase in non-food retail spending in the final quarter of the year, attributed to the growing popularity of Black Friday sales. However, the overall spending levels remained subdued. The official retail sales figures, scheduled for release on Jan. 30, are expected to indicate a softening in consumer spending following a surge in November.



This anticipated decline in spending reinforces market expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia may not implement further rate hikes in February. Major Australian banks, including Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac, have already called a peak in interest rates. Predictions from NAB and ANZ suggest that the first rate cut could occur in September, with a consensus forming around a potential cut in November.



ANZ analysts anticipate a supportive environment for spending in the second half of the year, driven by a combination of fiscal easing, slower inflation, and a projected rate cut in November.

Mumtaz, who is one of the greatest names in the Bollywood industry, didn't have a great start at the film industry. The actress, who is known for classics like Roti, Loafer, and Dushmun, was once labelled a B-grade actor. In a recent interview, the actress revealed the reason behind the same and how Dilip Kumar changed her career.

Why Mumtaz was labelled B-grade actor?

The 76-year-old actress, in an interview with DawnNews, revealed that she was labelled a B-grade actor because she did a lot of small roles.

She said, ""I was given the label of a B-grade actor because I did a lot of small roles. I also did comedy with Mehboob sahab. I just closed my eyes and did work. I thought the rest is in god’s hands. My start in the film industry was wrong.""

She added, ""I won’t blame the heroes for not working with me because everybody wants to climb the ladder of success.""

Mumtaz's label and career trajectory changed after Mehboob showed one of her scenes to actor Dilip Kumar and asked if he was willing to do a film with her.

Talking about the same, Mumtaz said, ""Mehboob sahab showed one of my scenes to Dilip Kumar sahab and asked him if he would work with me in Ram Aur Shyam. He told him that the girl was nice and he agreed. Dilip sahab was a very down-to-earth person.""

Dilip Kumar Too Was Skeptical About Working With The Actress?

According to Mumtaz, the actress and Dilip Kumar had a significant age difference when they signed for the film Ram Aur Shyam. Due to this Dilip Kumar initially raised concerns. However, after watching the trial shot of the film, the actor eventually agreed to the project, recognising Mumtaz's qualities such as her good height, fairness, and dancing skills."

United Nations - As the tensions between Iran and Pakistan escalate, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, urged both nations to de-escalate the conflict. On Thursday, the UN Chief gave his stance on the matter and went on to offer his good offices to help resolve all their issues. He went on to urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint and avoid any sort of escalations. The proclamation from the head of the international body came after Iran and Pakistan exchanged strikes, threatening a conflict spillover. Both countries justified their attacks by stating that they were targeting the terrorist bases in their respective nations.

“He (Guterres) is very concerned about this escalation, about the exchange of fire, rockets, between Iran and Pakistan. We have seen reports of casualties on both sides,” said the Secretary-General’s Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric when asked to comment on this week’s attacks and counterattacks between Iran and Pakistan. “He urges both sides to exercise maximum restraint, to avoid any further escalation,"" the spokesperson furthered. Similar sentiments were also expressed by the US and China after Pakistan unleashed a tit-for-tat attack against Iran on Thursday. “Any security issues, any issues, concerns, between Iran and Pakistan must be addressed through peaceful means, through dialogue, through cooperation, and again, in accordance with the principles of sovereignty, national integrity and good neighbourly relations,"" Dujarric concluded.

How did other international actors react?

While giving out the statement, Dujarric noted that the Secretary-General held a phone call with the Iranian foreign minister. In the call, Guterres insisted that the parties involved in the matter may meet at the UN headquarters in New York on Tuesday and this could be one of the issues that can be discussed. Just like the United Nations, the European Union also expressed its deep concern on the matter. “These attacks, including in Pakistan, Iraq and Iran now are of utmost concern for the European Union because they violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, and they have also a destabilising effect on the region,” EU spokesman Peter Stano said on Thursday, Dawn reported. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova mentioned that both nations are part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and hence should continue maintaining restraint. “It is regrettable that this is happening between friendly SCO countries, with which we are developing partnership relations. Further aggravation of the situation plays into the hands of those who are not interested in peace, stability, and security in the region,” said Zakharova."

EV Production: The luxury carmaker division of General Motors (GM), Cadillac, is ramping up production of its Lyriq compact, an e-sport utility vehicle, now with rise in battery availability and continous strong demand for luxury EVs, despite a slowdown for various types of EVs, said Global VP at Cadillac, John Roth.

Production of Lyriq has been far behind initial targets, hamstrung mainly by an issue with assembling battery modules that has crimped GM's EV plans.

The Michigan-based automotive-label Cadillac delivered 9,000 Lyriqs in 2023, according to John Roth. The luxury brand had delivered fewer than 2,400 units in the first half.

""It's been a measured build up and launch as battery modules have become available and, now that we're in a position with strong inventory, we're seeing great sales performance,"" Roth said, while adding he had ""high expectations"" of that continuing.

Lyriq now accounts for a quarter of all of Cadillac's sales, up from just about 12 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, he said.



""The luxury industry I think is operating at a little bit of a different level than the main market as it relates to EVs,"" the senior official said.



""We still see in the data, 60 per cent of the consumer base, that their next luxury vehicle will be an EV,"" he said.

High borrowing costs have dented consumer sentiment and several companies have warned of a slowdown in demand for EVs. Many automakers, including market leader Tesla, have cut prices sharply to lure potential customers.



Lyric was among the EVs that lost a US government tax credit this month as new sourcing guidelines kicked in.



However, GM is offering incentives of $7,500 to offset the loss and has said Lyric would regain eligibility early this year.



Meanwhile, Cadillac has been bolstering its EV lineup, as it eyes at offering a fully electric portfolio by 2030."

Since making her breakthrough in the 1976 film Taxi Driver, Jodie Foster has been quite selective about the roles she takes on. However, this has changed significantly over the past few months, as she starred in the highly anticipated film Nyad and also made a strong debut in 2024 with True Detective: Night Country. It is a well-known fact that she came close to being chosen for the Princess Leia role in the original Star Wars. In a recent interview, the actress reveals the reason behind her eventual departure from the role.

Why did Jodie Foster reject Star Wars?

During her appearance on NBC’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Foster revealed why she had to turn down the role of Princess Leia in the original Star Wars movie. The actress said, “They were going for a younger Princess Leia but I had a conflict. I was doing a Disney movie and I just didn’t want to pull out of the Disney movie because I was already under contract.”

Foster's casting would have most likely drastically changed the part. Foster would have only been 13 or 14 years old when the original Star Wars film was being made, and 15 when it came out in 1977. Eventually, Carrie Fisher, who was 19 at the time of filming, ended up playing the part.

The actress continued, “And they did an amazing job. I don’t know how good I would have been. I might have had different hair. I might have gone with a pineapple” (referring to the character’s famous Danish pastry hairstyle).

Although the former child star refrained from revealing the specific Disney film she was working on, Foster's film Freaky Friday released in 1976—a year before the success of Star Wars. Fisher starred in four more Star Wars movies after that including Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi. She died before she could film her scenes for The Rise of Skywalker, but Leia was included in the movie using previously unreleased footage from the set of The Last Jedi.

Even though she was unable to make an appearance in Star Wars, Foster went on to have a very successful career. The actress portrayed Clarice Sterling in the film Silence of the Lambs, a young FBI agent-in-training who goes to Dr. Hannibal Lecter for case advice.

The event, organised in Gandhi's constituency, is also intended to send a nationwide message to the Congress party and its leadership, who have rejected an invitation to attend the temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, according to sources.

The temple is located in a calm and peaceful area near the banks of the Ponkuzhi River, approximately 4 km away from the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary.

Washington - Amid the brewing tensions between Iran and Pakistan, US President Joe Biden said that the recent air strikes conducted by Islamabad and Tehran in each other's territory indicate that Iran is not “well-liked"". While speaking to the reporters in the White House, Biden urged both Iran and Pakistan to de-escalate the conflict. In span of just two days, the Islamic nations exchanged missile strikes, insisting that they were targeting the terrorist bases in the respective nations. The attacks sparked concerns all over the world since the Middle East is already dealing with the Israel-Hamas war and the tensions in the Red Sea.

""As you can see, Iran is not particularly well-liked in the region,"" Biden told reporters on Thursday at the White House when he was asked about the clashes, VOA reported. The comments from the US President came just hours after the White House released a statement on the matter and called both sites to exercise restraint. On Thursday, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby mentioned that the United States was monitoring the situation in the region “very very” closely. ""These are two well-armed nations and again we don't want to see an escalation of any armed conflict in the region, certainly between those two countries,"" Kirby told journalists aboard Air Force One. ""They were struck first by Iran, which was obviously another reckless attack, another example of Iran's destabilising behaviour in the region,"" he added.

UN chief condemns the attacks

Amid the chaos, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, urged both nations to de-escalate the conflict. On Thursday, the UN Chief gave his stance on the matter and went on to offer his good offices to help resolve all their issues. He went on to urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint and avoid any sort of escalations. The proclamation from the head of the international body came after Iran and Pakistan exchanged strikes, threatening a conflict spillover. Both countries justified their attacks by stating that they were targeting the terrorist bases in their respective nations.

Art and Aviation: While the inauguration of Airbus A350 on the first day of “Wings India 2024” exhibition being organised by the Union Civil Aviation Ministry in Hyderabad, created a record in India’s aviation history, Air India's focus on creative rebranding was also on display. The four-day event, which started on Thursday will continue till Sunday.

Leaving visitors spellbound, Tata-owned Air India Express showcased the latest addition to its fleet VT-BXH, a Boeing 737-8 aircraft adorned with the intricate ‘kalamkari’ pattern as part of its iconic new brand identity, said a statement of the airline. Kalamkari is a traditional Indian art form that involves hand-painting or block-printing on fabric using a pen-like tool called ‘kalam’ or wooden blocks.

Patterns of India theme

At its brand launch in October last year, Air India Express introduced the contemporary version of its tail art heritage with the ‘Patterns of India’ theme on the variable tail fin design of each new aircraft. Kalamkari often features intricate and detailed motifs, including mythological characters, epic scenes, flora, and fauna. The use of the ‘kalam’ in freehand drawing or block-printing results in fine outlines and details in kalamkari patterns. These designs often involve repetition and symmetry, creating visually appealing and balanced compositions, said the statement.

“The addition of this ninth Boeing 737-8 aircraft to Air India Express’ fleet is a testament to the rapid growth trajectory of the airline. The airline aims to add another 41 modern, fuel-efficient Boeing 737-8 aircraft in the next two years,” the statement said.

Aloke Singh, Managing Director, Air India Express said he was enthusiastic after the new addition, ""At Air India Express, our aim is to offer exceptional customer service with the unique warmth and cultural richness that is representative of India.

The Kalamkari-themed new aircraft is a symbol of our commitment to celebrating India's diverse cultural heritage through our varying tail art,” “As we continue to progress on this transformation journey, we aim to connect people, places, and cultures, offering a seamless and digitally enabled travel experience,” Singh said.

Nine art forms so far

Notably, Air India Express’ fleet boasts a vibrant array of aircraft, each uniquely reflecting the rich tapestry of Indian culture through its tail art. The airline’s tail art designs include diverse patterns from across the length and breadth of India. Bandhani and Patola from Gujarat, Gamosa from Assam, Jamdani from West Bengal, Jamawar from Kashmir, Phulkari from Punjab, Kanjeevaram from Tamil Nadu, Banarasi from Uttar Pradesh and Kalamkari from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. These designs pay homage to the diversity and craftsmanship of India's textile heritage, representing a fusion of cultural artistry and modern aviation. Air India Express’ unique and vibrant aircraft carry not just guests but also the essence of India's cultural legacy, making every journey a celebration of heritage and innovation, the airline has said.

Cricket experts underestimate India after Adelaide's loss in 2021

Cricket experts initially lacked confidence in the Indian Cricket Team, making significant statements and underestimating their capabilities. Notable Australian experts expressed skepticism:

MICHAEL CLARKE (Former Australia Captain): ""Can you imagine this Indian batting line-up without Virat Kohli for the next two Test matches? They are in deep trouble.""

MICHAEL VAUGHAN (Former England Captain): ""Told ya ... India are going to get hammered in the Test Series … #AUSVIND #4-0.""

RICKY PONTING (Former Australia Captain): ""There could be a good chance (of a whitewash)... With Kohli not being there... there's almost no one to pick them up after a loss like that.""

MARK WAUGH (Former Australia Captain): ""I just can't see how they (India) can bounce back after Australia whitewashed them on the third day (in Adelaide)... four-nil to Australia.""

BRAD HADDIN (Former Australia Keeper): ""I thought their (India's) only opportunity to win a Test match was at Adelaide... I don't think they'll be able to turn it around.""



Contrary to these opinions, the Indian squad, led by Ajinkya Rahane, delivered an exceptional performance, securing an impressive three-wicket victory. Rishabh Pant's outstanding contribution on the fifth day of the historic Test match played a pivotal role in this remarkable win.

Australia chose to bat first, posting a total of 369 runs in 115.2 overs, with Marnus Labuschagne scoring a century (108). Tim Paine contributed 50 runs, while Steve Smith, Matthew Wade, and Cameron Green added 36, 45, and 47 runs, respectively, setting the stage for an enthralling Test match that concluded with India's historic triumph at the Gabba.

In a historic Test match at the Gabba in Brisbane, T-Natarajan, Shardul Thakur, and Washington Sundar displayed brilliant bowling performances, each taking three wickets. Sundar and Thakur made significant contributions with scores of 62 and 67, respectively, as India, batting first, reached a total of 336 in 111.4 overs. Their crucial partnership of 123 runs for the seventh wicket rescued India from a precarious situation. Despite a narrow lead of 33 runs, Josh Hazlewood, the standout Australian bowler, claimed five wickets for 57 runs in 24.4 overs.

Australia set India a target of 328 runs after scoring 294 in their second innings, with Steve Smith top-scoring with 55. Despite losing an early wicket in the chase, Shubman Gill's composed 91 and Cheteshwar Pujara's gritty 56 off 211 balls laid a solid foundation. Rishabh Pant's unbeaten 89 off 138 balls in the last session of the fifth day guided India to a historic victory.

New Delhi: A Lucknow-based advocate has been fined Rs 1 lakh by the Supreme Court for seeking to quash the August 7 notification that restored Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's Lok Sabha membership in August 2023. For the unversed, RaGa’s membership was restored following the SC's order staying his conviction in a 2019 criminal defamation case relating to ‘Modi’ surname. Terming the petition 'frivolous', a bench of justices Bhushan R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta such petitions did not only waste the precious time of the court but also that of the entire Supreme Court registry.

“Every petition needs to go through multiple verification exercises in the court registry,” said the bench. It added that exemplary cost ought to be imposed on such petitions to deter litigants from misusing the avenue of public interest litigation (PIL).

Last year in August, the Supreme Court stayed Rahul's conviction in a 2019 defamation case over his Modi surname remark, paving the way for the revival of his Lok Sabha membership. A three-judge bench of Justices B R Gavai, P S Narasimha and Sanjay Kumar said no reason was given by the trial court judge while convicting Gandhi except that he was admonished by the apex court in a contempt case.

The top court had closed the contempt proceedings against Gandhi for wrongly attributing to it his ""chowkidar chor hai"" remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in connection with the Rafale case, with a warning to be more careful in future after the senior Congress leader tendered an unconditional apology.

Bengaluru: While PM Modi is scheduled to visit Bengaluru today, there have been last-minute changes in Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah's tour plan. According to yesterday's tour plan, CM Siddaramaiah was supposed to receive PM Modi at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda airport. However, in today's tour plan of the CM released by his office, it is mentioned that the CM will receive him at the Boeing air facility and not the Kempegowda airport.

Just hours before PM's arrival, CM Siddaramaiah took to social media to remind the BJP-led central government of its allegedly step-motherly treatment towards the state.

“It is not time for the central @BJP4India government to share its resources fairly and equitably with all the states of the Union of India. It has to bring itself to that level. Let the Center give up trying to suppress the fair voice raised by all southern states including Karnataka regarding tax share and resource allocation. Let him correct his financial misconduct,” he posted.

Meanwhile, DyCM DK Shivakumar will now receive PM Modi at the Kempegowda airport, along with chief secretary Rajneesh Goel.

Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon are currently on a promotional spree for their upcoming film Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljah Jiya. This is the first time the two actors have collaborated for a film. At the trailer launch event of the film held on Thursday, January 18, Shahid Kapoor revealed that the scripts he heard post Kabir Singh did not excite him enough to take them up.

Shahid, who played the role of a skilled surgeon, finds himself descending into a downward spiral of self-destruction when he learns that his girlfriend Preeti, portrayed by Kiara Advani, has chosen to marry another man. The 2019 film received mixed review. Some critiques were pointed towards the film for its portrayal of misogyny and toxic masculinity, accusing it of glamorising violence against women.

Shahid Kapoor reveals post Kabir Singh he wasn't offered exciting scripts

During the trailer launch event of Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljah Jiya, when Shahid Kapoor was asked if it was a conscious decision to shift back to the romantic comedy genre after starring in projects like Bloody Daddy and Farzi, where he played intense characters, he responded by saying, “Post Kabir Singh, I didn’t hear anything that was exciting.” He continued, ""Then popped in this film, and I was like, this is it. We have to tell a love story that hasn’t been told before. Will people like it, or not like it, will they accept it, not accept it, that’s the journey as an artiste, as a creative person that you have to take.""

He went on to express his desire to do something lighthearted and enjoyable, while admitting that it is a difficult genre to master. Shahid emphasised the difficulty of finding scripts that offer something new to the audience. While adding that love stories are especially challenging, Shahid said he believes Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya addressed the issue of how to introduce novelty into a love story. “I have been missing doing something light and fun definitely but honestly it is the most difficult genre to crack. I listen to ten scripts a month. People don't know that but there is so much to hear. I know people tell me, ‘Aur picture karo’ but it is so difficult to find scripts that you feel that you are going to offer the audience something new. Love stories are the most difficult genre to do.”

Reflecting on his experience with Kabir Singh, he stated that the character in that film was new to him. ““When I did Kabir Singh, the character was new for me, the entire journey, the way the entire relationship was, it was shocking but it was new,” he added.

Gaza - As the devastating Israel-Hamas war continues to escalate, reports are emerging that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has reportedly destroyed the Gaza Strip's ""last standing universities"". A video is circulating online in which an abandoned building can be seen left in complete shambles after a massive explosion rips through and the smoke engulfs the skies. As the video started going viral, the Palestinian side said that the university that was blown up in the attack was the Al-Israa University and accused the IDF of conducting the explosion. However, the Israeli forces are yet to confirm the whole ordeal. The chances of resolution of the conflict started to become bleak after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the establishment of a Palestinian state even after the ravaging war.

According to The Middle East Monitor, for the past 70 days, the Israeli forces were allegedly using the massive university after occupying it and converting it into a military barracks and detention centre. “The IDF occupied the university building for 70 days, turning it into a military base and a centre for sniping isolated civilians in the areas of Rashid Street, Al-Mughraqa and Al-Zahra, as well as a temporary detention centre for interrogating Palestinians, before detonating it,"" the University administration statement said in a statement, According to the Middle East Monitor. “We condemn the barbaric aggression that targeted the capabilities of students of knowledge, the latest of which was the destruction of the building of graduate studies and the main bachelor’s colleges in the south of Gaza City,"" the statement further reads. During the ground operation, the Israel side attacked major buildings situated in the coastal enclave. The Israeli forces have accused Hamas of setting up long tunnels below these crucial buildings.

Netanyahu rejects the idea of a Palestinian state

Amid the chaos, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the prospect of establishing a Palestinian state after the ongoing war and pledged to resist the United States on the same matter as well. In a nationally broadcast news conference, the Israeli premier vowed to push an aggressive offensive in the Gaza Strip and gain a “decisive victory over Hamas”. Netanyahu mentioned that he had conveyed his rejection to the Palestinian state while having talks with the United States, The Times of Israel reported. Shortly after the Israeli premier's proclamation became public, the White House rejected the assertion and pledged to work towards a robust two-state solution.

“In any future arrangement … Israel needs security control of all territory west of the Jordan [River],” Netanyahu said in a combative press conference on Thursday. “This collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?” he asked. Netanyahu who is grappling with public discontent within Israel and all around the world, insisted that a prime minister should be “strong enough” to say no, even to the country's friend. “The day after Netanyahu, it’s the day after most of Israel’s citizens. For 30 years, I have been consistent, saying one simple thing: this conflict is not about a lack of a state but about the existence of a state,"" he said. “Every territory we pull out from, we get terror, terrible terror against us. It happened in southern Lebanon, it happened in the Gaza Strip, and it happened in [the West Bank] when we did it, in parts. The prime minister needs to be capable of saying no to our friends,"" the Israeli premier furthered, The Times of Israel reported.

As a devout ""Ram Bhakt"", Modi has been visiting temples in different parts of the country in the last few days, including Ramkund and Shree Kalaram Temple in Nasik, Veerbhadra Temple in Lepakshi in Andhra Pradesh and Guruvayur Temple and Thriprayar Shree Ramaswami Temple in Kerala.

Similarly, he will visit more such temples in Tamil Nadu over the next two days. These temples not only act as a unifying force for different parts of the country but also have a connection with Lord Ram, they noted.

His visit to temples across the country in the last few days and listening to Ramayana in multiple languages and participating in bhajans in the temples is significant as its impact goes much beyond the commonly understood realm of religion, they said.

Guwahati: Kuldeep Singh, Security Adviser to Chief Minister N Biren Singh of Manipur and head of the Unified Command of Manipur, has voiced alarm over the escalating attacks in Moreh. Singh highlighted the involvement of Kuki militants and armed groups based in Myanmar in the recent incidents of violence.

Multiple instances of violence have been reported recently in various locations near Moreh, a border town in India along the Indo-Myanmar border. In one such attack on Thursday, a commando of Manipur Rifles and a personnel from the India Reserve Battalion (IRB) lost their lives.

""Since early morning yesterday, a significant number of Kuki militants initiated firing on Commando forces at three locations. Intelligence reports suggested the presence of People's Democratic Front (PDF) insurgents operating in Moreh, and reinforcements from Myanmar posed a threat to the forces in Moreh, prompting heightened alertness,"" said Kuldeep Singh.

""In these attacks, two security personnel, CDO W Samarjit Singh of Manipur Rifles and T Saileshwar Singh of IRB, were martyred, and several others sustained injuries. Critically injured individuals have been transferred from the Assam Rifles Hospital in Casper Vehicles to Imphal,"" added Kuldeep Singh.

The gun battle persisted until late afternoon, and with the deployment of reinforcements from joint forces in the evening, the area was eventually cleared. Ongoing area domination operations are in progress with additional reinforcements from Imphal.

The coordinated attacks were carried out by Kuki militants, supported by PDF insurgents from Myanmar. Notably, most recent attacks in Moreh were orchestrated from a remote location in Myanmar. However, Thursday's attacks occurred in close proximity.

""The heightened activities are a cause for concern, and forces in the region have been placed on high alert. Regrettably, Kuki militants play an active role in targeting innocent civilians and security forces indiscriminately,"" remarked Kuldeep Singh."

What was the controversy around Mohanlal starrer Neru ahead of its release?

Neru directed by Jeethu Joseph and featuring Mohanlal as the main lead was embroiled in a controversy regarding plagiarism. A writer named Deepu K Unni had moved the court seeking a stay on film’s release alleging that the script for the movie was plagiarised from a screenplay that he had written.

Director Jeethu Joseph addressed the claims on his Facebook handle, stating, ""Neru has been crafted with utmost sincerity and enthusiasm."" He further added, ""A person has claimed rights to the story of Neru and has taken the matter to court. The synopsis of the person's claim, along with case files, has been circulating on social media. I urge the audience to discern the truth after watching the film in theatres tomorrow. - Jeethu Joseph."" However, the Kerala High Court refused to stay the release of the Mohanlal-starrer Neru and it was released in theatres as planned.

The United Nations' World Tourism Organisation predicts a full recovery from the pandemic in 2024. International tourist arrivals are anticipated to surpass 2019 figures by 2 per cent, signalling a robust comeback for the sector.

The positive outlook is attributed to increased global air connectivity and a strong resurgence in Asian markets. Despite concerns over geopolitical instability in the Middle East and other regions impacting traveller confidence, the UN tourism body remains optimistic about a complete rebound in tourism activities worldwide this year.

In 2023, travel demand in Europe and Africa nearly reached pre-pandemic levels and even surpassed them in the Middle East. Notably, destinations such as Mediterranean Europe, the Caribbean, and certain sub-regions in Central America and North Africa exceeded their international tourism arrivals from 2019.

Anticipating a significant boost, the UN organisation foresees a soaring Chinese market in 2024. This follows the Chinese government's decision to allow visa-free travel for citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Malaysia until November 30, 2024. Furthermore, an increase in flight capacity into and out of China is expected this year.

In 2023, international tourism rebounded to 88% of pre-pandemic levels, attracting an estimated 1.3 billion international travellers. The overall industry's contribution to the global economy in 2023 amounted to an impressive $3.3 trillion, according to the latest report. These encouraging trends point towards a promising year for the international tourism sector in 2024, with various regions and markets showing resilience and recovery.

Vadodra: The boat tragedy in the Harni area on Thursday serves reminder of the Sursagar boat tragedy of 1993 that had left 22 persons dead. Even after 30 years of the incident, neither the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) nor the authorities learnt any lesson.

The auspicious occassion of Janmashtami--August 11, 1993-- turned sorrowful for the families of the deceased after the boat overloaded 38 persons against capacity of 20, capsizing in the Sursagar lake.

Reports suggested that boat operators had insurance for those using the service in the pond. The compensation for families of the victims were slashed after the insurance company stated that its liability was limited to 20 persons only.

Similar Tragedy After 30 Years

In a seprate but similar incident after 30 years, 14 school children and two teachers died drowning after their boat capsized in the Harni Pond of Vadodra in Gujarat.

The distressing tragedy unfolded after apparent violation of safety norms. Why 31 people were allowed to board the boat when the capacity was 14? The question ‘overloading’ is again being faced by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

The worst that none of the onboard travellers were given life jackets, which probably could have saved some lives.

“The incident happened as the boat was overloaded. Our teachers had told the people out there about it, however, they started the boat without even providing life jackets to all the students,” says Russy Wadia, trustee of New Sunrise School.

A case has been registered against 18 people in connection with the death of 12 students and 2 teachers in the Vadodara boat capsize incident.

Hatsun Agro Product, a prominent player in the country's dairy industry known for brands like Arun Ice Creams and Arokya Milk, disclosed its third-quarter results, revealing 24 per cent increase in profit. However, the growth marked the slowest in three quarters, primarily attributed to the severe floods in Tamil Nadu caused by cyclone Michaung.

Tamil Nadu, home to 13 out of Hatsun's 20 milk processing plants, bore the brunt of the natural disaster. Despite challenging conditions, the Chennai-based company managed to achieve a profit after tax of Rs 57 crore for the quarter ending December 31. This growth rate represents the slowest since the March quarter of 2023.

Advertisement

Total expenses, driven by increased raw material costs, rose by 11.2%, offsetting Hatsun's 11.3% rise in revenue. The revenue growth was the highest the company has recorded since the March quarter of 2023, reflecting a productive flush season. The flush season, occurring from October to February, witnesses heightened milk production due to lower temperatures, enabling dairies to stockpile supplies for the lean season.

The industry landscape will be further illuminated when rivals Heritage Foods and Dodla Dairy release their third-quarter results later this month. Following the financial disclosure, Hatsun Agro's shares initially surged 3.7 per cent to hit four-month high.

However, they later relinquished these gains, trading 2.1 per cent lower. The mixed market response suggests that investors are weighing the company's resilience amid challenging circumstances against the potential long-term impacts of the recent natural disasters on its operations and revenue.

With former President Trump's resounding victory in the Iowa caucuses and an anticipated triumph in New Hampshire, the Republican Party is abuzz with speculation about potential running mates. The swift return of Washington's favourite parlor game underscores the perception that Trump's nomination is increasingly seen as inevitable, mere days after the initial GOP primary votes were cast.

The fallout from former Vice President Mike Pence's certification of President Biden's election win on January 6 has positioned loyalty as a top priority for any potential running mate.

Selecting the correct running mate is crucial to attract more voters

While the Republican Party remains fractured and questions persist about Trump's vulnerabilities in a general election, the selection of a running mate must also be strategic, as per a report from Axios. Despite Trump's claim to have already decided on a running mate, his campaign downplayed the assertion, though media reports and comments from top surrogates suggest that a shortlist has emerged.

Top Contenders

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.): The chair of the House GOP conference and the first member of Congress to endorse Trump, Stefanik is positioned at the top of the reported shortlist. Trump's praise for her as a ""killer"" follows a viral confrontation with university presidents over campus anti-Semitism.

Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio): A staunch defender of Trump's populist views on immigration and ""America First"" foreign policy, Vance is considered a strong contender. Donald Trump Jr. expressed his support for Vance, citing alignment and aggressiveness as key factors.

Nikki Haley: Despite her assertion that she doesn't ""play for second,"" Haley remains in consideration, particularly for a unity ticket that could attract moderates and swing voters. However, her hawkish foreign policy views and establishment ties could trigger a revolt in MAGA world.

The veepstakes also include other notable names, such as Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Vivek Ramaswamy, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, former HUD Secretary Ben Carson, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), and Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake.

As the political spotlight intensifies, all eyes will be on Trump's final choice, a decision that could significantly shape the dynamics of the upcoming presidential race."

Shivam Dube's change in fortune

Ever since he has joined the Chennai Super Kings franchise in IPL, Shivam Dube's performance has picked an upward trajectory. The left-hander took India out of trouble in the 1st T20I and guided the team towards victory with an unbeaten 60 off 40 balls. The all-rounder stepped up in the second match as well, scoring 63 off 32 to fetch India a 6-wicket victory. Dube could not continue the flow of runs in the 3rd T20I, but his contribution in the 1st and 2nd T2OI was enough to render him the man of the series trophy.

The left-hander is receiving immense praise for the way he batted against Afghanistan and according to veteran India spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, his striking suave is reminiscent of the flamboyance of former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh.

Ravichandran Ashwin lays weight on how Shivam Dube reminds him of Yuvraj Singh

Ashwin, who regularly expresses his views on the happenings around the game through his official YouTube channel, paid heed to the emergence of Shivam Dube and said the following:

Advertisement

“Hardik Pandya is a crucial member of this Indian team. However, the emergence of Shivam Dube… Just like how we divide ears into Before Christ and After Christ, we can divide his career into ‘before CSK’ and ‘after CSK’. In West Indies conditions, which are almost CSK conditions, he is a spin-hitting monster,” the off-spinner said.

R Ashwin referred to Dube as ""Yuvraj Singh lite"", and reasoned his calling by juxtaposing the attributes of the two.

“I can proudly call him ‘Yuvraj Singh lite’ package. There are so many factoids about Yuvraj Singh that I could see in his game - the downswing, the height and the reach. I am not saying that he is like Yuvraj Singh, just saying he reminds me a lot of him. The beauty here is that he hits spin straight down the ground,"" he added.

Ashwin further stressed the potential of Dube complementing Suryakumar Yadav from the other end. He then highlighted Dube's prowess with the ball and stated that him entering the mix of things has only given the potential World Cup arsenal more shine.

“When Suryakumar Yadav is playing at one end, a team might try to suppress him by playing a left-arm spinner. When Shivam Dube is that the other end at this point, this is a great combination to have. The options that he gives to the team are tremendous. He can bowl two overs of his quota too,"" Ashwin said. ""He has proved that he can bowl cutters and has developed a back-of-the-hand slower delivery as well. It has just added worth in gold going into this World Cup.""

While Ashwin was elaborative about how Shivam Dube reminds him of Yuvraj Singh, he did not address Yuvraj's recent critique of his (Ashwin's) game."

Surgeons externally attached a pig liver to a brain-dead human body, observing its successful blood filtration, marking a progression towards potential application of the technique in patients experiencing liver failure. The University of Pennsylvania revealed a groundbreaking experiment on Thursday, Jan 18 presenting a unique approach to animal-to-human organ transplants. In this instance, a pig liver was utilised externally not internally within the donated body. This method serves as a ""bridge"" to assist failing livers by conducting the organ's blood-cleansing functions externally, much like to the process of dialysis for deteriorating kidneys.

The experiment represents a departure from traditional animal-to-human transplants, known as xenotransplant which have faced repeated failures over the years due to the rejection of foreign tissue by the recipients' immune systems. However, scientists are now revisiting this avenue using pigs whose organs have undergone genetic modifications to make them more akin to human organs.

In the past few years, there have been instances of temporarily transplanting kidneys from genetically modified pigs into brain-dead donors to assess their functionality. Additionally, two individuals underwent heart transplants from pigs; however, both patients succumbed within months of the procedures.

The US Food and Drug Administration is contemplating the possibility of permitting a select group of Americans in need of a new organ to volunteer for intensive studies involving either pig hearts or kidneys. Some researchers are also exploring the potential use of pig livers, recognizing that the liver presents distinct complexities compared to kidneys and hearts. Its functions include blood filtration, waste removal, and the production of substances essential for various bodily functions.

Approximately 10,000 individuals are presently on the waiting list for a liver transplant in the United States. In the University of Pennsylvania experiment, researchers affixed a pig liver genetically modified by eGenesis to a device created by OrganOx. This device is typically employed to preserve donated human livers before transplantation. The family of the deceased, whose organs were unsuitable for donation generously provided the body for the research.

Machines were responsible for maintaining the circulation of the body's blood during the experiment. Conducted last month, the process involved filtering the blood through the pig liver-device for a duration of 72 hours. The team at the University of Pennsylvania reported in a statement that the donor's body remained stable and the pig liver exhibited no signs of damage.

Considerable efforts are underway to develop liver dialysis-like machines, with experiments involving pig livers having been conducted years ago, although using less advanced genetic techniques compared to today's methods. Dr. Parsia Vagefi of UT Southwestern Medical Center, while not directly involved in the recent experiment it is closely monitoring xenotransplantation research.

""I applaud them for pushing this forward,"" remarked Dr. Parsia Vagefi, expressing admiration for the efforts involved in advancing this approach. He described the combination of pig liver and the associated device as an intriguing step in endeavors aimed at improving care for individuals facing liver failure."

Firstly, SLIM is landing in the mid-latitudes on the near side of the Moon whereas Vikram of Chandrayaan-3 close to the Moon's south pole. According to JAXA, SLIM will be aiming to land within a 100 meters target area near the Shioli crater on the near side of the Moon.

JAXA has chosen a small patch of land for the touchdown to fulfill one of the mission objectives which is demonstrating ""accurate lunar landing techniques embodied in a small explorer.""

Chandrayaan-3, on the other hand, made its soft-landing about 600 km from the lunar south pole and its objective was to demonstrate ISRO's safe landing and roving abilities on the Moon along with conducting in-situ experiments.

Another major difference is that the Vikram lander carried the 26-kg Pragyan rover whereas SLIM has two mini rovers. Named Lunar Excursion Vehicles 1 and 2 (LEV-1 and LEV-2), the rovers, one of which is the size of a baseball and has been developed by JAXA, Tomy, Sony, and Doshisha University, will study the characteristics of the Moon.

The Japanese mission, however, is similar to Chandrayaan-3 in one key aspect. SLIM and the rovers have been designed to study the Moon for one lunar day as Vikram and Pragyan. Since SLIM and the LEVs do not have heating units to keep the payloads warm, they are unlikely to wake up after enduring the cold once their planned mission span ends and they are put into sleep mode like Vikram.

ISRO's Chandrayaan-3 mission (which had three components) had a price tag of approximately $75 million (including launch costs) whereas SLIM has been developed at a cost of $120 million. Moreover, the Vikram lander weighed around 1,726 kg whereas SLIM weighs roughly 200 kg (around 700 kg with fuel)."

Merry Christmas hit the big screens on January 12. Headlined by Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi, the film is directed by Sriram Raghavan. The movie was shot simultaneously in English and Hindi. In a new interview, the filmmaker opened up about the box office result of the film.

Sriram Raghavan says Merry Christmas will pick up pace in second week

After a week of theatrical run, Merry Christmas has been able to mint nearly ₹14 crore at the domestic box office. While the business is steady, the collection saw a steep decline. During a recent interaction, the director opened up about the success of the film which is being pitted against his last film Andhadun.

""We are expecting the second week to be good. Though many people were like, we came expecting this film to be like Andhadhun, but this happens with everyone after a successful film. I liked Shaan as much as Sholay,"" he said, giving the example of the two Ramesh Sippy hits which released five years apart.

Sriram Raghavan says he wanted to make Merry Christmas like a no-interval film like Ittefaq

Starring Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif, the film, set over the course of a night, revolves around two strangers whose lives get entwined after they cross paths at a restaurant on Christmas eve. ""The biggest enjoyment for me as a director was the way it shifted while scripting to editing, slowly from that hard-nosed thriller to this romance. Initially, I thought it would be a 90-minute thriller with no interval like ‘Ittefaq’. That was my thing. But as we fleshed it out, it changed for the better and the best.

""I’m so glad that we decided to shift the focus as we fell in love with these characters. It became a film about broken relationships and two broken people. Essentially, it is a love story, which is disguised like a thriller. That’s the big twist,"" Raghavan told PTI in an interview.

Apple antitrust case: The European Commission has officially announced its invitation for feedback from competitors and consumers regarding the concessions put forth by Apple to address EU antitrust charges and potentially avoid a substantial fine. This confirmation aligns with an earlier Reuters report.

As part of the proposed commitments, valid for a decade, Apple is offering third-party service providers access to its tap-and-go mobile payments systems used for mobile wallets. The EU competition watchdog had previously accused Apple of hindering competitors' entry to its Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, impeding the development of alternative services on Apple devices.

In response, Apple stated in an email, ""We have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.""

This access extends to developers of payment, banking, and digital wallet apps within the European Economic Area (EEA), presenting an additional choice alongside the existing Apple Pay, which will continue to be widely available. The Commission clarified that the use of these apps for payments in stores outside the EEA would also be feasible.

Consumers will have the flexibility to choose between using Apple's service or another NFC-enabled application through their bank or card issuer for payments. Apple outlined additional commitments, including features such as defaulting to preferred payment apps and access to authentication features like FaceID.

Interested parties, including rivals and customers, have a one-month window from the summary's publication to provide feedback. Once approved, the implementation of these commitments will be overseen by a trustee reporting to the Commission.
