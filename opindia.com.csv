The statement has been opposed by a wide range of politicians, including some leaders from within the Samajwadi Party.

The OpIndia team spoke with the families of the victims and surviving karsevaks, as well as the locals of Ayodhya, to obtain information about the 1990 atrocity. We learned that during that time, a political leader by the name of Fasih-ur-Rehman Munnan Khan, popularly known as Munnan Khan had participated in the killings. The karsevaks who were far from the disputed structure were also reportedly murdered.

Who granted MP Munnan Khan permission to commit mass murder?

A former police officer stationed in Ayodhya in 1990 spoke to OpIndia on condition of anonymity. He unveiled that he received information in the year 1990 about the involvement of the then Balrampur MP late Munnan Khan along with his associates in the attacks on the karsevaks. His full name was Fasih-ur-Rehman. According to the ex-official, the local administration and the government were aware of Munnan Khan’s onslaught on the karsevaks. However, his influence in politics was so strong that no one even mentioned him. Some of Rudauli’s surviving karsevaks who witnessed the incident also brought up his name during the interview with OpIndia.

According to them, Munnan Khan was riding in a bus with his aides while dressed as a police officer. He used to tell the karsevaks, “Come sit in the bus. Let us give you the prasad of Ayodhya.” No karsevak knows how Munnan Khan who was posing as a cop was permitted to travel by bus while the karsevaks were being apprehended even while walking.

Sanjay, son of Ram Achal Gupta and Kali Sahay, son of Ram Bahadur Verma the karsevaks who sacrificed their lives for Ram Mandir also conveyed that MP Munnan Khan was directly involved in the slaughter of karsevaks. Some local residents remarked that Munnan Khan and his people not only fired on the karsevaks but also posed as police and abducted the Ram devotees in a bus to a location unknown to this day.

Munnan Khan was an MLA from the Katra assembly constituency under Gonda district from 1985 to 1989 after which he became an MP from Balrampur district from 1989 to 1991. He was considered close to senior Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders. An intersection in Gonda district is also named after him. He died in 2009.

in light of Swami Prasad Maurya’s comments, the family members of the karsevaks who were martyred want to know if Munnan Khan’s actions were legal or allowed by the Samajwadi Party. We’ll soon be sharing with you our second report which will detail Munnan Khan’s criminal past, dark activities and cruel conduct.

Murder of those far away from the Ram Janmabhoomi

Shivdayal Mishra, a karsevak who lives in the Gonda district talked to team OpIndia. He was shot twice in the leg during karseva in 1990. He divulged that he had taken the bullets at the border of the Gonda district which is at a considerable distance away from the ‘hot zone’ that was the Ayodhya town, especially the area around Ram Janmabhoomi site. The doctors who were sitting in the temporary tents at the time on government instructions fled the shelter out of fear of being shot by the police.

Abhishek, the son of deceased karsevak Mahavir Prasad Agarwal expressed that he was deeply hurt by the statement of Mulayam Singh Yadav which followed his father’s death. Abhishek stated that on 2nd November 1990, his father was shot dead near Karsewakpuram which was a long way from the babri structure.

Simultaneously, Suresh, son of victim Ramesh Pandey informed OpIndia that his father had been shot close to Shaheed Gali. Numerous Lord Ram worshipers were killed there. Hanumangarhi is situated between this area and the contested structure which is located far distant.

Karsevak Ram Achal Gupta’s son Sanjay disclosed to OpIndia that his father was shot on 2nd November 1990 in front of the Ayodhya police station which is not far from the earlier controversial structure. Ramtej, his brother, was performing karseva at the time. He is a living eyewitness to the tragedy in 1990. According to Ramtej, all of the karsevaks were gathered around and chanting Ram Bhajans (devotional songs of Lord Ram) as the bullets were fired at them.

Helicopters also shot bullets at unarmed karsevaks

Ayodhya’s local elders also told OpIndia that karsevaks had arrived unarmed in 1990. According to karsevak Raghuwar Singh of Rudauli locality in the Ayodhya district, shots were fired on 2nd November 1990 as everyone assembled to visit Janmbhoomi. A helicopter was hovering a few kilometres away from the disputed structure.

Seema Gupta, the daughter of martyr karsevak Vasudev Gupta stated in an interview with OpIndia that her father and other Ram devotees were killed with the help of a helicopter. A helicopter with green lights was circling over Ayodhya in the sky then. The cops would open fire at the exact moment when the chopper would fly down and its lights would turn red.

The son of another martyr karsevak Ram Sevak Verma, Kali Sahay Verma informed us that not only the cops on the ground but some armed personnel aboard the helicopters were also firing. He highlighted that the pellets penetrated his father’s body at an oblique angle and suspects that his father was shot from above.

‘Muhammad Usman and JS Bhullar were the leaders of the firing team‘

All the elders and karsevaks who reside in Ayodhya still remember the names of JS Bhullar and Muhammad Usman. They were both paramilitary officers. JS Bhullar along with his team used to camp at Maharaja Inter College in Ayodhya. The location of Maharaja Inter College where he used to bathe is also remembered by the locals due to the cruelty displayed in 1990.

An incident involving Bhullar was recounted by a local citizen who requested to remain unnamed. According to the witness, on 30th October 1990, a chopper came from Lucknow with orders to fire following which scared the local cops. They didn’t want to shoot at the karsevaks and were firing bullets into the air.

The source added that after JS Bhullar noticed gunfire in the air, he approached these police officers and reprimanded them. He aimed and fired at a Ram devotee who was walking by. The moment the bullet struck, the person went down and instantly passed away. JS Bhullar then chuckled and commented, “This is how you shoot.”

The other squad led by Muhammad Usman was raining bullets at the same time. He reportedly held the position of Deputy Commandant within the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). It is believed that he and his unit were present when the karsevaks were killed in large numbers close to Shaheed Gali and Digambar Akhara. All of them shot the Ram devotees in the head and chest, instead of aiming for the legs as security personnel are supposed to, as per locals.

Ayodhya’s elders often say that the locals cops were not involved in the shooting, but it was the paramilitary central forces. A battalion of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police is also mentioned in this context.

According to the ex-officer, external forces were summoned to initiate gunfire. After the Ayodhya slaughter, a poem gained popularity in the local areas which bore the lyrics, “The earth trembled and the sky cried when bullets were fired in Ayodhya.” It further reads, “When Uttar Pradesh police refused, cops were called from Tibet."

He was 71 and had been battling with a prolonged illness for the past several months. Rana was undergoing treatment at the PGI hospital in Lucknow.

Born on November 26, 1952, in Uttar Pradesh’s Raebareli, Munawwar Rana is known for his Urdu literature and ghazals.

In 2014, he was honoured with the Sahitya Akademi Award for his poem, ‘Shahdaba’. However, he had returned the award, alleging ‘intolerance’ in the country.

He also received other awards, including the Ameer Khusro Award, the Mir Taqi Mir Award, the Ghalib Award, the Dr Zakir Hussain Award, and the Saraswati Samaj Award, throughout his career.

It was alleged a few years ago that one of Rana’s most highly-acclaimed poems was stolen from Hindi poet Alok Srivastava.

Rana last made headlines in 2021 when he likened Maharshi Valmiki to Taliban. The UP Police booked him for his derogatory comments against Hindus by drawing false equivalence with radical Islamic organisation Taliban that has captured Afghanistan.

Rana went ahead to make a dastardly metaphorical statement to defend the Taliban. Rana had also threatened to leave Uttar Pradesh if Yogi was reelected as CM.

In January 2021, he took to social media to poetically incite a mob to violence. In the tweet which was deleted later, Rana gave a call to demolish the Parliament building and set the godowns for grains storage on fire.

In October 2020, Rana made a condemnable remark on the brutal beheading of French History teacher Samuel Paty by an Islamist terrorist. He supported the terrorist attack saying that he would have done the same.

A year after the Ram Janmabhoomi verdict, Rana made repugnant remarks against the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi saying “Even a prostitute in India charges more for selling herself than Ranjan Gogoi did.”

In May 2020, an old letter penned by poet Alok Srivastava addressed to Munawwar Rana went viral on social media in which he alleges the Urdu poet of stealing his couplet and brazenly garnering accolades for it.

This came after he called 100 crore Hindus as ‘animals’ and 35 crore ‘humans’ in India.

Along with the festivities and rituals, the country is also paying homage to countless unsung Ram Bhakts who sacrificed their lives to reclaim the revered birthplace of Shri Ram in the five centuries-long drawn struggle.

During ground reporting in Ayodhya, the OpIndia team learned that the first massacre at the hands of the police in the Mulayam Singh regime took place 8 days before 30th October 1990. Evidently, on 22nd October 1990, the police, who had gone to raid based on information about Kar Sevaks being present, opened fire in a village in Basti district near Ayodhya. In this indiscriminate firing, three Ram Bhakts from the village lost their lives, while many others were injured.

Ram Chander Yadav was the first martyr in the massacre that took place on 22nd October 1990. The in-charge of the Duboulia police station received information about the presence of Kar Sevaks in the village of Sandpur. Their informant had informed the police that the Kar Sevaks gathered in the village were planning to march towards Ayodhya. The police surrounded the village. In an atmosphere filled with devotion to Ram Lalla, people from the village of Sandpur and surrounding areas gathered in protest against the police action targeting Ram Bhakts. During the protest, the police took orders from higher-ups and opened fire on the villagers.

We visited the home of the martyr Ram Chander Yadav to gather information about their current situation.

The victim Ram devotee Ram Chander was a minor

Ram Chander Yadav was originally from the village Barasana Tedhwa in the Basti district. This area falls under the jurisdiction of the Duboulia police station. The Sarayu River is located approximately 1 kilometer away, and its other bank touches the boundary of Ayodhya city.

When we reached Ram Chander’s house, his brother Ramnath Yadav was present there. Ramnath Yadav mentioned that Ram Chander Yadav was the third among five brothers. He told the OpIndia team that Ram Chander was around 16 years of age when he was fatally shot on 22nd October. The surviving brothers managed to overcome the sorrow in their own ways, engaging in various small jobs to sustain the family.

Thatched and Unplastered House

Ram Chander Yadav’s surviving family is living in a state of extreme poverty. Their house is divided into two parts. The first part is thatched, and the second part consists of a section of a Pucca house, which lacks both flooring and plaster. For agricultural activities, the family took a loan and acquired a tractor-trolley. Now, at nearly 60 years old, Ramnath Yadav shared that, in the sorrow of losing his son, his father Ram Narayan Yadav had lost his life, and a few days later, his mother also passed away.

According to Ramnath, his brother Ram Chander had just started helping them manage expenses for household activities when he became a victim of police bullets during the Mulayam government.

He was shot in the head

Ram Chander Yadav was a staunch devotee of Lord Ram and Mahadev Shiva. Ramnath Yadav became emotional while recalling the incidents that transpired on 22nd October 1990. He said that villagers had gathered near a field against the excesses of the policemen targeting Ram devotees. During this time, the police surrounded them, and without warning, opened fire on the villagers. In this indiscriminate firing, Ram Chander Yadav was hit and he fell into the fields. He wasn’t provided with any medical treatment. Due to being shot in the head, Ram Chander couldn’t survive for long, and in a short while, he breathed his last.

Raids were conducted to nab the remaining brothers

Ramnath Yadav told the OpIndia team that during the firing, it was chaotic, and it wasn’t clear who went where. After the police left, people started searching for their relatives and family members. Ram Chander didn’t return home. Family members learned about Ram Chander being shot in the firing. After some efforts, they found out that Ram Chander’s body was kept at Basti District Hospital. The family was about to leave to collect the body when the police team again raided the village.

During the raid, the police also tried to apprehend the remaining brothers of late Ram Chander. Fearing the police excesses, the remaining brothers of the victim also left the house and ran away. Consequently, only Ram Chander’s old father and mother were left in the house. According to Ramnath, there was such fear of the police at that time that the other young members of his Yadav-dominated village also left their homes and hid somewhere.

The dead body was not allowed to enter the village

Speaking with the OpIndia team, Ramnath recalled that 22nd October 1990 was the most difficult time for his family. He added that when the remaining brothers and well-wishers of the village fled away fearing a police raid, his old parents somehow had to go to Basti, about 50 kilometers away. At that time even vehicles were not running due to strict police security. Even Ramnath doesn’t know how his father Ram Narayan Yadav along with his wife reached the dead body of his brother.

When Ram Narayan Yadav reached Basti Hospital with his wife, he was told that his son’s body was lying in the postmortem house. When he reached there, Ram Narayan saw a heavy police force deployment. When his wife started crying after seeing her son’s dead body, the police stopped her.

Ram Narayan received clear orders that he could not take his son’s body to the village under any circumstances. The father of the deceased pleaded for cremation as per Hindu rituals but the then authorities did not budge.

Ultimately, the cremation of Ram Chander Yadav took place at the cremation ground on the banks of the river in the city, a short distance away from the Basti District Hospital. During this period, apart from the old parents, a heavy police force remained deployed. Ram Chander’s family returned to their village empty-handed at night. Due to the remaining sons absconding out of fear of the police, the other posthumous rites of Ram Chander also took a long time.

Couldn’t keep even a single picture

Other members of the family also have resolute faith in Sanatan Dharma. Ramnath Yadav mentioned that they are very happy with the construction of Lord Ram’s temple in Ayodhya. Unfortunately, according to Ramnath, they couldn’t save even a single picture of his brother. As per Ramnath, there was limited use of cameras and other facilities in 1990, and because of their poor economic condition, they couldn’t take photos, and towards the end, the entire family had to flee due to police actions.

Ramnath wishes that his brother Ram Chander should also be remembered during the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. His family wishes that the government should build a memorial of Ram Chander Yadav in Ayodhya."

Angrez Singh from Fazilka decided to write the exam by donning the guise of his girlfriend, Paramjit Kaur. Decked out in red bangles, a bindi, lipstick, and a ladies’ suit, Angrez Singh was ready.

Nevertheless, the scene was now primed for Punjab’s most unforeseen comedic performance, as university officials promptly became aware of the ruse and lodged a complaint with the police.

As per the police, Angrez Singh went to great lengths in his attempt, employing counterfeit voter and Aadhar cards to establish his identity as Paramjit Kaur. The scheme appeared flawless until the crucial instance when his fingerprints did not align with those of the actual candidate on the biometric device.

In a regrettable turn of events, the authentic candidate, Paramjit Kaur, had her application rejected by the administration. Simultaneously, legal proceedings have been initiated against Angrez Singh."

The accused Suleman is said to have murdered the victim for marrying his niece, Sultana. The FIR in the case was registered on 14th December but it is reported that to date, the police have taken no action in the case.

According to the report by Aaj Tak, Sultana and victim Das were in love. The woman married the latter 3 years after the death of her earlier husband. Sultana was worried about the future of her two kids so she decided to marry Das after falling in love with him.

While the family of the woman had no problem with her second marriage to a Hindu, her maternal uncle, Suleman, had warned her regarding the marriage. He had threatened that he would do something unfavourable to stop the marriage. While the two married without any incident, the accused murdered Das 10 months after he tied the knot with Sultana.

Suleman is said to have spiked drinks offered to Das with poison, after which he immediately passed away. The accused believed that the woman had sinned by marrying a man belonging to the Hindu religion.

The woman has appealed to the police to take strict action against the accused. She said that she expects justice to be delivered to her second husband who was brutally murdered by the accused. The murder is said to be executed on 13th December, and the police filed an FIR in the case on 14th December.

Further investigations into the case are underway."

In the audio message, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun accused PM Modi of the assassination of Khalistani terrorist and Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He claimed that PM Modi is on the “radar” of pro-Khalistan Sikhs. He further threatened that on Republic Day, SFJ would avenge the “assassination” of Nijjar and would raise the Khalistan flag. He then “dared” PM Modi to come to Delhi without security, and SFJ would “avenge” the assassination of Nijjar.

It has become a habit for US citizen and designated Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun to issue threats to the Indian Prime Minister, Union Ministers, and diplomats before special events such as Republic Day. For years, Pannun has been indulging in such activities. A few days ago, he also released a statement urging multinational companies not to invest in Vibrant Gujarat, a state-level program to attract investments. In his message, he called the Indian government “Nazi”.

Interestingly, Sikhs For Justice, whose social media handles have been withheld or blocked in India, have bought a “Golden Verified Mark” on X (formerly Twitter). It means SFJ is paying USD 1,000 to X every month for the same under the X Premium membership program for businesses. It is a matter of concern that X has allowed a terrorist organisation to have a verified account, that too, a business account, on its platform.

Who is Gurpatwant Singh Pannun

Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is a US-based Khalistani terrorist who has citizenship in both the US and Canada. He poses as an attorney in the US and claims to be a front-runner in the fight for the rights of Sikhs. In reality, he consistently propagates the Khalistani sentiments and often issues threats against India. He has been actively promoting violence against Indian diplomats in Canada, the US and other countries where pro-Khalistani Sikhs have been living. He was designated as a terrorist by the Government of India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for his anti-India activities. His organisation, Sikhs For Justice, was also listed as a terrorist outfit by the Government of India.

The murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and accusations against India

In June 2023, Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was killed in Canada by unknown assailants, probably as a result of a gang war. However, in September 2023, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, accused India of being involved in the murder.

Following the accusations, Canada also expelled a senior Indian diplomat. India categorically denied any involvement in the murder and expelled a senior Canadian diplomat in retaliation.

Furthermore, 41 more Canadian diplomats were asked to leave the country and warned to strip them of their diplomatic immunity. In October, the diplomats of Canada left India.

Canada tried to gather support from its Western allies but failed to do so. Even after months of the diplomatic blunder that Canada made, India is yet to receive any credible evidence that Indian agents were involved in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

India has also raised the issue that the Canadian government has been harbouring terrorists and giving them political and financial backing on its soil. Since the accusations, Indian diplomats and Hindus living in Western countries are facing threats from the Khalistani elements."

In a video on Monday, she urged people to observe the consecration day. Before that video, another video of her receiving the Akshatam from Ayodhya also went viral on social media. Though a few celebrities have supported her, others have criticised her. Notably, Chithra has over 45 years of singing career in the industry.

Indu Menon, an author, criticised Chithra and said, “Singer Chithra may be singing hymns in praise of Ram, Vishnu, Sita and Murugan. But that does not mean standing with killing innocent people. She has freedom of expression and can join any side of the issue. But glorifying a cause that led to genocide is cruel, even if it is inoffensive. Even if you Kindle five-wick lamps, no light will fill your mind”.

Singer and composer Sooraj Santhosh also criticised her. They said, “She forgets that the temple was constructed after demolishing the mosque. Icons are waiting to break down, one after another. How many Chithras are waiting to show their true colour?”.

While these celebrities called Chithra out and claimed the temple was being constructed after demolishing a mosque, they forgot the fact that the disputed structure that they were referring to as a mosque was built after demolishing Ram Mandir 500 years ago. Notably, Goswami Tulsidas had mentioned in one of his writings about the demolition of the temple and the construction of a mosque in its place.

Singer G Venugopal came out in support of Chithra and said she was never involved in any controversies. He added that Chithra was sad over the insults she was facing on social media. He said Chithra has no political affiliation and only concentrated on her career for over 44 years. He said, “If we disagree with her, why can’t we pardon her at least once? There won’t even be a revolutionary home sans mothers and elders who advise reciting nama japa in the evening, attending church every Sunday, and praying five times daily. You can disagree with these people. They have attained immortality in our music world. My only request is that we should be careful not to hurt them,” in a post in Malayalam on Facebook.

On the one hand, Hindus across the world celebrate the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha ceremony, but on the other hand, left-liberals and anti-Hindu elements ridicule Hindus for expressing their happiness. Even opposition leaders of parties like Congress, Samajwadi Party and others claim that BJP made the Pran Pratishtha ceremony a political event. There are claims that the temple is being constructed using government funds, but that is false. Ram devotees donated over Rs 3,500 crores for the construction of the temple."

As per reports, following the deactivation of the seat belt sign at 2:13 am after departure from Mumbai, a male passenger headed to the restroom but became unexpectedly locked inside. He remained in the confined space until the aircraft landed in Bengaluru at 3:10 am, at which point technicians were able to unlock the door.

The passenger reportedly sought help from the crew members after he couldn’t open the door to the lavatory from inside. The crew members slipped in a note through the cracks in the folding door of the loo, asking him to remain calm while expressing their inability to open the door from the outside.

“Sir, we tried our best to open the door. However, we could not open it. Do not panic; we are landing in a few minutes. So please the commode lid, sit on it and secure yourself. As soon as the main door is open, the engineer will come. Do not panic,” the note read.

The passenger remained in the lavatory until the plane landed at the Bengaluru airport, upon which a technician helped wrench the door open, following which he received immediate medical support.

SpiceJet issued a statement, apologising for the incident and affirming that the passenger would receive a complete refund. The airline also noted that the traveller received assistance throughout the entirety of the journey.

Earlier this week, passengers travelling from IndiGo airlines in several cities across the country had to face severe delays purportedly due to harsh weather conditions, as reported by the airlines to the DGCA. The delays sparked outrage among passengers, with many untoward incidents reported, notably the assault on a cabin crew member by a fellow passenger."

“The FCRA has been cancelled via order received on January 10″ and the institution will weigh its options to seek justice,” Yamini Aiyar, President, CPR said while speaking to ANI.

Yamini Aiyar is the daughter of controversial Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar.

The MHA cited reports published by CPR on “current affairs programs” as one of the reasons for the cancellation.

The MHA’s action comes almost a year after CPR’s FCRA registration was suspended for 180 days and then the suspension was extended for another 180 days. The MHA suspended the FCRA licence of CPR in February last year.

Earlier in September 2022, the Income Tax department conducted a ‘survey’ operation against CPR, and two other organisations- Oxfam India and a Bengaluru-based Independent and Public-Spirited Media Foundation (IPSMF) — as part of a probe to look into their foreign funding.

In July 2023, the Income Tax Department reportedly informed the ‘Centre for Policy Research (CPR),’ run by the daughter of Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar, about the withdrawal of its tax exemption status.

Oxfam India’s foreign funding is also blocked in India as MHA, in December 2021, refused to renew its FCRA licence. Parallelly, the Central Bureau of Investigation is also investigating Oxfam India.

The CPR then filed a challenge in the Delhi High Court against the suspension of its license too.

The MHA then contended that CPR’s foreign funding should be ceased due to concerns about receiving foreign contributions for undesirable purposes that could impact the country’s economic interests.

The MHA had further accused the CPR of transferring foreign contributions to other entities and depositing them in non-designated accounts, violating the FCRA.

The National President of the outfit has also sent a letter to the son of Mulayam Singh Yadav – Former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav. In the letter, he requested Akhilesh Yadav to be present at the time of installing his father’s statue in the mosque.

Roshan Pandey wrote in his letter to Akhilesh Yadav that his “Jannati (Heavenly) Father Mulayam Singh” struggled throughout his life for the Muslim community. He mentioned that Mulayam Singh Yadav dedicated his entire life to oppose the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, and gave orders to massacre Karsevaks. Pandey argued that while Mulayam Singh Yadav may not have contributed to the Ram Mandir, he definitely contributed to the construction of a mosque, which is now coming in Dhannipur, Ayodhya, as per the Supreme Court verdict.

The National President of Rashtriya Hindu Dal added that Mulayam’s statue will be installed in the Dhannipur mosque to acknowledge this contribution and pay tribute to him. He mentioned that the stone to be used for carving the statue will be brought from Kichhauchha Sharif Dargah. Subsequently, the stone will be cleansed using water from various dargahs, including Ajmer Sharif, Haji Ali, Darul Uloom Deoband, and Kaliyar Sharif.

Roshan Pandey has said that for the event, he will also invite those Muslim Maulanas with whom Mulayam Singh Yadav used to observe Roza and Iftari.

Going further, Roshan Pandey inquired that if Akhilesh Yadav wishes, a Namaji cap will be ordered from Delhi’s Jama Masjid and placed on the statue. According to Pandey, Mulayam’s statue will be similar to the pictures seen during Iftaar, where he used to eat dates with Muslims.

Roshan Pandey has stated that the statue will be installed in the mosque at the time of Akhilesh Yadav’s choosing. He has also appealed to invite Muslims from Muslim countries like Palestine, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Palestine-Gaza to this program, where slogans of Jai Samajwad should be raised.

Pandey has also sought permission from the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Jamiat Ulema Ul Hind to install Mulayam Singh’s statue in the courtyard of the Dhannipur mosque. He emphasised that he will bear all the expenses incurred but it would be great if someone extended support.

Regarding the installation of an idol in the mosque, Pandey noted that AIMPLB and Jamiat may have objection to it as Islam does not allow it. However, he gave a counterargument to this.

He has argued that there should not be any problem with the statue of Mulayam Singh in the mosque because there was a lot of uproar regarding the picture of Muhammad Ali Jinnah being kept in AMU. He also cited the example of the statues of Tipu Sultan in Karnataka. He has also appealed to both these organisations to name this mosque ‘Mulayam Masjid’."

On Tuesday (16th January), during the cabinet meeting, the proposal was approved. Currently, Rs 1250 crore has been granted for the initiative.

The CM Nitish Kumar-led government would provide this benefit based on data from the recently conducted caste census. According to the Bihar government’s caste census, the state has 94 lakh 33 thousand poor families. The Bihar government classifies families earning less than Rs 6000 per month as poor.

The Nitish government plans to provide Rs 2 lakh in financial help to 94 lakh families to ‘launch small businesses’ over the next five years under the ‘Bihar Small Entrepreneur Scheme’. The funds will be distributed to poor families in three installments.

The Bihar government will provide Rs 250 crore in 2023-24 and Rs 1000 crore in 2024-25 for the implementation of this scheme. This move by the Nitish government has come ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and is being interpreted as an effort to lure voters.

However, some are raising concerns regarding the ‘Bihar Small Entrepreneur Scheme. According to the recent census, the Bihar government estimates that approximately 2.7 crore families reside in the state. 94 lakh people, or about one-third of them, are classified as poor.

If the aid of Rs 2 lakh is extended to each of these families, that figure comes to a staggering amount of Rs 1.88 lakh crore. Questions have been raised as to how the Bihar government will raise the whopping amount.

The Bihar government has stated that the scheme will be completed within the next five years. Even if the Bihar government is committed to completing the scheme in five years, it appears to be a long way off. For this, the Bihar government will need to allocate roughly Rs 37000 crore annually which would be a herculean task for the RJD-JDU coalition government.

Bihar’s budget for 2023-24 was Rs 2.62 lakh crore. To allocate Rs 37,000 crore, the budget needs to increase by at least 15%. Bihar does not receive a large amount from tax collection, and this amount cannot be raised through loans either.

Bihar currently has a state debt of approximately Rs 2.90 lakh crore, as stated in Parliament. This constitutes approximately 38% of Bihar’s overall GDP. According to the guidelines for taking out a loan, Bihar’s debt has already reached its ceiling. In such a scenario, the question arises as to how can the Bihar government secure additional loans.

Providing Rs 2 lakh to 90 lakh families appears to be a daunting fiscal undertaking, notwithstanding the scheme’s temporary success on paper and in speeches. Conspicuously, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar seems to be rolling out this scheme only for electoral gain, rather than to alleviate poverty."

These trains which will run from various cities, tier 1 and tier 2 towns from different states to Ayodhya Dham station and back for 100 days following the Ram Mandir opening ceremony will only have operational stoppages, according to sources in the Railway Ministry.

66 rakes with 22 coaches will be used to run these services to Ayodhya. A circular issued by the railways said the tickets for these trains will be booked for round trips. Notably, tickets for these trains can be booked only through the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). These trains can’t be booked through the Passenger Reservation System of Indian Railways.

There will be charges associated with reservations, superfast, catering, service and Goods and Services Tax (GST). IRCTC will provide vegetarian meals for onboard catering.

These trains will be launched from seven stations in Maharashtra including Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Wardha, Jalna and Nashik; the national capital’s New Delhi, Old Delhi, Nizamuddin and Anand Vihar; Telangana’s Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kazipet Jn; nine stations in Tamil Nadu’s consisting of Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Salem among others; Jammu and Kashmir’s Jammu and Katra; Gujarat’s Udhna, Mehsana, Vapi, Vadodara, Palanpur, Valsad and Sabarmati; Madhya Pradesh’s Indore, Bina, Bhopal and Jabalpur as well as Goa. Other cities include Agartala, Tinsukia, Barmer, Dehradun, Bhadrak, Khurda Road and Kottayam.

Trains will arrive in Ayodhya at the end of comparable routes that have been planned from each state. Furthermore, there are five routes that lead to Ayodhya from the northeast with the majority of the trains coming from Assam or Guwahati. The railways declared that the tickets would be reserved for round-trip travel, in a circular. Railways has chosen not to enter the train’s details into its Passenger Reservation System (PRS) even though the IRCTC would handle reservations owing to security considerations.

Ayodhya’s much-awaited Ram Mandir will be inaugurated on 22nd January in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other significant dignitaries from the arenas of politics, sports, entertainment, business, religion and spirituality among others."

As part of the second MOU, Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) announced an investment of over Rs 5,000 crore for the establishment of two pump storage projects (PSPs) to bolster sustainable energy solutions. These projects will have capacities of 850 MW at Koyabestagudem and 500 MW at Nacharam.

The third MoU was signed by Ambuja Cements for an investment of Rs 1,400 crore to construct a state-of-the-art 6 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) cement plant in the next five years. The plant will be spread across 70 acres and it will increase Ambuja’s production capabilities, and offer employment opportunities for over 4,000 individuals, both directly and indirectly.

Additionally, Adani Defense Systems and Technologies Limited has pledged over Rs 1,000 crore for the next decade to set up counter-drone and missile facilities. The investment focuses on establishing a comprehensive ecosystem dedicated to the research, development, design, manufacturing, and integration of counter-drone and missile systems.

The Adani Aerospace Park will generate employment for over 1,000 people and serve as a hub for these critical defense capabilities and contributing to India’s defense preparedness.

Yet another embarrassment for Rahul Gandhi with his colleagues busting the baseless allegations that had already been rejected in the court of law

It is important to note that the MOUs between the Congress-led Telangana government and Adani Group on 17th January came despite a long-drawn smear campaign against the Indian conglomerate by Gandhi scion Rahul, who is considered to be dictating terms in the grand old party.

Notably, according to Rahul Gandhi’s allegations, Gautam Adani’s wealth soared higher only because the Union and state governments (specifically accusing BJP) made quid pro quo deals with the business group and sold or leased strategic assets, opened new frontiers only for the business tycoon, while overlooking other business groups – favouritism. He further alleges that this is all done illegally to favor the Adani group. Notably, he had been trying to implicate Adani as a partner in crime with PM Modi coining the word MODANI by merging the names of Modi and Adani.

Yet both his I.N.D.I. alliance partners and Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states have trashed his allegations and bunkum against the Indian business tycoon. Here are examples of how Congress’ I.N.D.I. alliance partners and their Chief Ministers have gone ahead to draw investment from the Adani group.

Before that, it has to be stated that the developments come against the backdrop that concerned financial regulating authorities and the Supreme Court had categorically stated that SEBI had not found evidence against the Adani group.

Congress and alliance partner-ruled governments rush to seek investment from the Adani Group

The Telangana government signing a deal with the Adani group is not the only setback to Rahul Gandhi’s tirade against the Group.

Most recently, on 9th January 2024, Adani Group signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) with the DMK-ruled Tamil Nadu government, to invest over Rs 42,700 crore at the Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet 2024. DMK is Congress’ alliance partner in the I.N.D.I.A. bloc.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, State Industries Minister T.R.B. Rajaa, and the Managing Director of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Karan Adani were present at the signing of the MoUs, along with Cabinet Ministers and Secretaries of various government departments.

Previously, on 23rd December 2023, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar showered praises on the business tycoon Gautam Adani for donating Rs 25 crore to set up a new technology center in Baramati.

Following the inauguration, Pawar thanked Gautam Adani and Vijay Shirke of Shirke Constructions for donating the funds for the project. He had said, “I must take Adani’s name and thank him for his contribution.”

Before that, on 14th December 2023, in the Bihar Business Connect 2023 event, the Adani Group announced to significantly boost its current investment in JDU-RJD-ruled Bihar from Rs 850 crore to a substantial Rs 8700 crore.

In November 2023, West Bengal’s commerce and industry minister clarified that the state government is working with the Adani Group to build a deep-sea port at Tajpur in the East Midnapore district. The Minister in the TMC-ruled government dismissed reports that the Adanis have withdrawn from the joint venture. TMC is also an alliance partner of the Congress party in the I.N.D.I.A. bloc.

In October 2023, Congress and CPI(M) were up in arms to get credit for Adani’s new mega port in Kerala which was India’s first deepwater container transshipment hub in Vizhinjam. It was inaugurated on 15th October. The port has been developed by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. in collaboration with the LDF-ruled Kerala state government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

On 20th February 2023, two Adani Group-owned cement plants that had shut shop since December 2022 resumed their operations in Himachal Pradesh, following the intervention of Congress CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu.

After the plant resumed its operation, the Congress Chief Minister boasted of how he helped Adani-owned cement factories to resume operations.

Additionally, when the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government was in power in Rajasthan it had signed deals for several projects from the Adani group during the Invest Rajasthan 2022 Summit. The conglomerate has outlined plans to invest Rs. 65,000 crores in Rajasthan over the next 5-7 years.

During the tenure of the Maha Vikas Agadhi government, in which Congress was an alliance partner, the Adani Group was able to secure the Dighi port project in Maharashtra.

The company successfully purchased a 100% stake in Dighi Port Limited (DPL) for Rs. 705 crores with a plan to invest over Rs 10,000 crore to develop it as an alternative to Jawaharlal Nehru Port, the country’s largest container port.

Apart from the investment front, there have been rifts within the I.N.D.I. alliance over Rahul Gandhi’s unhinged diatribe against the Adani group with allegations that didn’t stand its ground in the courts.

Evidently, according to media reports, in September 2023, Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Gautam Adani during the third I.N.D.I. alliance meeting in Mumbai. He tried to attack the central government by raising the name of Adani, however, Mamata Banerjee was upset over the development. She stated that Rahul Gandhi did not take any of his allies into confidence before raising the issue of Adani.

Mamta Banerjee said that without discussing with fellow parties and without their consent, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of Gautam Adani.

Conclusion

The shoot-and-scout strategy by Rahul Gandhi against the Adani group considers itself immune from accountability and facing defamation proceedings by exploiting a deep-rooted communist mindset where ‘profit’ is a dirty word and there is a pessimistic perspective about capitalists, assuming that wealth generation is inherently linked with corruption. But successive elections have shown that the public has moved past such sly-of-hand tactics and doesn’t see wealth generators as ‘anti-national’ if there is no criminality involved.

Click here, to read how the opposition particularly the one shepherded by Rahul Gandhi has used baseless allegations with the sole intention of personal angst against PM Modi.

The underlying intention or the wishful dream behind Rahul Gandhi’s repeated attacks on Adani has been to destroy the “incorruptible image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi” to smithereens as once admitted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi himself. As stated above, the I.N.D.I. alliance partners including DMK, TMC, NCP, JDU-RJD, and CPI(M) as well as all Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states have signed agreements with the Adani group clearly hint that even they don’t buy Rahul Gandhi’s baseless smear campaign against the Indian conglomerate choosing ways to do employment generation rather than sycophancy."

In a press conference, Congress leaders seemed to dodge answering the question about why the Telangana government signed MoUs with Adani.

When a journalist highlighted that while the Congress party has aggressively attacked the BJP government over Adani, then why did the Telangana government ink a deal with the business conglomerate in Davos, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram shifted the mics for spokesperson Supriya Shrinate to answer. However, Supriya, too, refused to answer, asserting that the press conference was held for the manifesto launch and questions should be limited to that topic only.

Notably, the party leaders were left red-faced after the Congress-led Telangana government on 17th January signed four Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) worth Rs 12,400 crore with the Adani group at the sideline of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2024 in Davos, Switzerland.

According to a media release by Adani Group, the agreements were signed in the presence of Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, and Adani Group’s Chairman Gautam Adani. The MOUs signify a major stride towards fostering green, sustainable, inclusive, and transformative economic growth in the region.

In the first MOU, Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL) has pledged to invest over Rs 5,000 crore in establishing a cutting-edge 100 MW data centre over the next 5-7 years. The data centre will prioritise sustainability and it will rely on renewable (green) energy sources for its operations. The initiative is expected to generate direct and indirect employment opportunities for 600 people. The AEL will collaborate with local Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and startups to develop a globally competitive supplier base for the project.

As part of the second MOU, Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) announced an investment of over Rs 5,000 crore for the establishment of two pump storage projects (PSPs) to bolster sustainable energy solutions. These projects will have capacities of 850 MW at Koyabestagudem and 500 MW at Nacharam.

The third MoU was signed by Ambuja Cements for an investment of Rs 1,400 crore to construct a state-of-the-art 6 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) cement plant in the next five years. The plant will be spread across 70 acres and it will increase Ambuja’s production capabilities, and offer employment opportunities for over 4,000 individuals, both directly and indirectly.

Additionally, Adani Defense Systems and Technologies Limited has pledged over Rs 1,000 crore for the next decade to set up counter-drone and missile facilities. The investment focuses on establishing a comprehensive ecosystem dedicated to the research, development, design, manufacturing, and integration of counter-drone and missile systems.

The Adani Aerospace Park will generate employment for over 1,000 people and serve as a hub for these critical defence capabilities contributing to India’s defence preparedness.

However, the business deals run counter to the long-drawn smear campaign run by Congress leaders, including former president Rahul Gandhi, who had accused the Centre of crony capitalism by favouring Adani and his companies.

Notably, according to Rahul Gandhi’s allegations, Gautam Adani’s wealth soared higher only because the Union and state governments (specifically accusing BJP) made quid pro quo deals with the business group and sold or leased strategic assets, opened new frontiers only for the business tycoon, while overlooking other business groups – favouritism. He further alleges that this is all done illegally to favour the Adani group. He had been trying to implicate Adani as a partner in crime with PM Modi coining the word MODANI by merging the names of Modi and Adani.

Even as Rahul Gandhi and Congress craft a political narrative for the upcoming general elections in 2024 that involves running a smear campaign against PM Modi and linking Adani’s economic rise to favouritism by the Centre as a centrepiece of their poll strategy, their party leaders and alliance partners continue to ink deals with the business conglomerate to fulfil their election guarantees and realise growth plans."

The accused was a student of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

According to a statement issued by Uttar Police ATS, Faizan Bakhtiyar was wanted by the ATS, and a Rs 25,000 reward was announced for information leading to his arrest. The accused was a part of the Aligarh module of the Islamic terrorist outfit Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and had enrolled in the Aligarh Muslim University Master of Social Work course.

Reportedly, accused Faizan informed the authorities during questioning after his arrest that one Rizwan Ashraf had made him take the oath of allegiance to ISIS. Subsequently, he along with several others was involved in anti-national activities.

According to reports, Faizan Bakhtiyar was also collaborating with terrorism-accused students Abdullah Arsalan, Maaz Bin Taraki, and Wajiduddin, who were recently apprehended. During the investigation, the police found that these individuals had been planning to carry out terror activities in the country. Notably, Abdullah Arsalan and Maaz bin Tariq, members of the ISIS Pune module, were taken into custody on 3rd November last year.

The UP ATS had confiscated “prohibited” literature from the accused. The anti-terrorism unit had received information that, influenced by ISIS, certain radicalised persons were engaging in anti-national activities and formed a “jihadi group” on the orders of their handlers in the ISIS. Bakhtiyar was connecting people with the ISIS Aligarh module.

As reported earlier, 24-year-old Faizan Bakhtiyar, a native of Prayagraj was residing at the VM Hall hostel of AMU and was pursuing a master’s degree in social work from there. Bakhtiyar and another accused Abdul Samad Malik had links to the Students of Aligarh Muslim University (SAMU) and used to participate in propaganda for ISIS.

The module comprised multiple Aligarh Muslim University students. ATS identified these students and discovered that they were associated with Aligarh Muslim University students Abdul Samad Malik, Faizan Bakhtiyar, Mohammed Arshad Warsi and Mohammed Shahnawaz Alam from Jharkhand, Rizwan Abdul Haji Ali who is a native of Delhi, Wajihuddin Ali Khan, Abdullah Arsalan and Maaz bin Tariq from Aligarh, Mohammad Naved Siddiqui of Chandausi, Sambhal and Rizwan Ashraf from Uttar Pradesh.

On 3rd November 2023, the ATS filed a formal complaint against Shahnawaz and ten other individuals under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and Indian Penal Code sections 121-A (conspiracy to wage war against the country) and 122 (collecting arms and ammunition with the intention to wage war against the nation).

On 11th November, Wajihudeen who is another module member was captured in Chhattisgarh’s Durg. Officials revealed that he possesses a PhD from AMU and is employed by the ISIS network while masquerading as a member of SAMU. Wajihuddin Ali Khan, the recently arrested ISIS terrorist, was associated with the Al Haya Min Allah campaign at AMU, promoting extremist ideologies against democracy, nationalism, and other religions. Wajihuddin was also involved in the anti-CAA protests."

Three of the victims were travellers from neighbouring Jharkhand and two others suffered significant injuries as a result of a full-fledged altercation between the two parties. An argument broke out between a shopkeeper and a person after the latter parked his car in front of his shop in the Nabinagar locality. Police on 16th January arrested six persons for beating three people from Jharkhand to death and wounding two others.

The incident occurred in Tetaria Mod under the jurisdiction of the Nabinagar police station while five people from Palamu district, Mujahid Raain, Arman Ansari, Charan Mansoori, Wakil Ansari and Ajeet Sharma were driving towards Sasaram. They got into a fight with the store owner over parking the car after stopping at a restaurant. One of them pulled out his pistol and fired a shot at the store owner as they were arguing. However, 60-year-old villager Ramsharan Chouhan was wounded by the bullet and then died while receiving treatment.

The event incensed the locals who beat Mujahid, Arman and Chaman who were all in their mid-30s to death after holding all five individuals captive. Wakil and Ajeet are receiving medical attention at a hospital after sustaining severe injuries.

“Six persons have been arrested in the case, based on technical evidence. We have registered two FIRs, one for the murder of Ramsharam Chauhan and another for the death of the three youths,” proclaimed Sapna Gautam Meshram, Superintendent of Police Aurangabad.

Aurangabad Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Mohd Amanullah Khan informed, “Although the incident involves members of two different communities, there was no communal angle to the clash. Nonetheless, adequate deployment of forces has been made to prevent any eventuality.” He stated that the passengers were from the Hydernagar region and the four-wheeler had come from the Palamau district.

He mentioned, “Upon reaching Nabinagar, the driver stopped by, parking the vehicle in front of a shop in Taitariya Mod. The shopkeeper objected, leading to a heated exchange. One of the occupants of the car whipped out a gun and fired a shot which hit a bystander.” He added that a bystander identified as local Ramsharan Chauhan passed away instantly which angered the onlookers who had gathered there.

The official noted, “The irate mob pounced upon the occupants of the car, hitting them with whatever they could lay their hands on. By the time a police party reached the spot and dispersed the mob, Mohd Mujahid, Charan Mansoori and Mohd Ansari had been beaten to death.” Ajeet Sharma was referred to a hospital in Gaya due to his serious condition whilst Vakil Ansari who was admitted to the Sadar Hospital in Aurangabad was stable."

Hindus across the country and the world are preparing to celebrate a Deepawali-like festival on this occasion, which came after a struggle for Ramjanmabhoomi for 5 centuries.

The Hindu community is remembering those Ram Bhakts who laid their lives for Ram Janmbhoomi from the Mughal period to the Mulayam period. Karsevak Jairaj Yadav was one such Ram Bhakt.

Jairaj Yadav was shot in the Sandpur village of Basti district on 22nd October 1990. He was protesting against the police team entering the village in search of karsevaks and committing atrocities. Subsequently, Jairaj Yadav experienced persistent health issues, ultimately succumbing to them in May 2023. OpIndia paid a visit to Jairaj Yadav’s residence to gather information regarding the present circumstances of his family.

Family living in distress

Martyr Karsevak Jairaj Yadav originally hailed from the Hengapur village in the Basti district of Uttar Pradesh. He is survived by 50-year-old widow Radha Yadav, two daughters Khushbu and Chanchal and a son Durgesh. All of Jayaraj’s children are aged between 18 and 24 years.

When the OpIndia team reached their house, Radha and Durgesh had gone out somewhere. Both daughters were present at home. Jayaraj’s family is living in abject poverty.

Numerous sections of the house lacked plaster, and instead of a finished floor, there were brick pebbles. The kitchen items were in a state of disarray. The living conditions were such that for external visitors, the only offering available was water, presented in a broken glass.

Jairaj Yadav was shot in the head

Khushbu Yadav, the younger daughter of the late Karsevak Jairaj Yadav, told us that her mother had narrated to her the true story of her father’s work on Ramjanmabhoomi in her childhood.

During those times, karsevaks from different parts of the country used to stay in the Sandpur village. The villagers used to provide food and shelter to the karsevaks. They would also help karsevaks to cross the river by boat and reach Ayodhya. Meanwhile, someone informed the police. On 22nd October 1990, the police raided this village early in the morning.

When the police could not find any karsevak, they started harassing the women and children. The villagers started protesting this police action. Jairaj Yadav was also involved in this protest. The police force, along with the paramilitary, then opened fire at the protestors.

Khushbu Yadav welled up with tears as she remembered her father. She explained that shrapnel from a police-fired bullet hit her father Jairaj Yadav’s head, causing him to collapse in injury immediately upon being shot.

The police team moved forward to apprehend him and take him along. Simultaneously, a few villagers shouldered the wounded Jairaj Yadav, attempting to move him away from the gunfire. However, the police rushed to snatch him from the villagers.

Jairaj Yadav was sent to jail without better treatment in an injured condition. According to family members, the pellet that hit Jairaj’s head caused pus formation in Jairaj Yadav’s brain. The villagers also claim that Jairaj was brutally tortured at the police station despite being injured.

Jairaj Yadav was made an accused despite being shot at

Jairaj Yadav encountered a dual setback when the government of Mulayam Singh Yadav implicated him as an accused in the police onslaught on the village. On 23rd October 1990, the case was filed based on the complaint by the then SHO Dubaulia. Jairaj Yadav, among numerous villagers from various castes and classes, faced charges under section 7 of the Criminal Act, along with sections 147, 149, 307, 332, 333, 353, and 336 of the IPC.

Jairaj Yadav’s already frail health further deteriorated after learning about the case. Yet, the fellow villagers arrested alongside Jairaj Yadav supported him. This helped him become normal.

In an injured condition, Jairaj Yadav was kept in jail for about 1 month. The family members somehow got him bailed with the help of the villagers. Munnilal Yadav, saddened by the torture on his son, also suffered from many diseases after a few days. About 20 years ago, Jairaj Yadav’s father Munnilal died.

Jairaj Yadav combated against death for 32 years

Jairaj’s elder daughter Chanchal Yadav told us that Jairaj was undergoing treatment since 1990 when he was shot at. She told that some bullet shrapnel was stuck in the head. Due to this, pus had formed in a part of the head. Despite extensive medical care, Jairaj never fully recovered. He lived for approximately 32 years but never managed to regain normalcy. Jairaj was treated from Basti to Lucknow but the bullet shrapnel in the head never allowed him to become normal.

Jairaj’s younger daughter Khushbu Yadav told us, “Our father’s head ached almost every day. He would start screaming in pain. Many times he even fainted. For this reason, we would not send him anywhere alone. After becoming conscious, he used to remain normal for a short time but later suddenly the pain would start.” According to Khushbu, all medicines were ineffective in her father’s treatment. Finally, after fighting death for a long time, Jairaj Yadav passed away on 29th May 2023.

Jewelry and fields sold for treatment and lawsuit

Khushbu, the younger daughter of the late Jairaj Yadav, shared that their family’s financial situation is currently dire. The household is facing a shortage even of basic food grains. The extensive medical treatment endured by Jairaj over nearly three decades and the legal proceedings against him compelled the family to sell their jewelry and farmland.

In addition to this, they are burdened with debts amounting to lakhs of rupees, presenting a separate and considerable challenge. Money lenders visit their home daily, demanding repayment. Jairaj Yadav’s dependents are left with some farmland and a house. The family expresses concern that selling these remaining assets would leave them homeless.

Khushbu Yadav wanted to become a doctor, but had to quit education

All three children of Jairaj Yadav have dropped out of studies. His son Durgesh Yadav is trying to improve the family’s financial condition by doing some job. At the same time, both daughters Chanchal and Khushbu have also stopped going to school due to financial constraints.

About 400 tractors and 1,000 farmers from all around southwest France descended upon the city and assembled at various locations around the region before daybreak.

Rumbling into the ancient city centre of Toulouse in the early morning light, they blocked full lanes on certain roads and created enormous traffic jams while blowing their horns and towing trailer loads of hay and excrement.

Farmers protesting in Toulouse don’t hold back with how they show their displeasure against the French government. You mess with a French farmer at your peril. pic.twitter.com/Bk3HIM0NjU — James Melville (@JamesMelville) January 16, 2024

The head of the local police force urged people to stay away from central Toulouse and bus services were forced to alter their routes. The tractors dumped dozens of trailer loads of rotten fruit, hay and manure in front of the regional authority headquarters as soon as they arrived. Approximately one thousand farmers flocked to the Capitole square on foot and later in the day, a delegation was scheduled to meet with the chief of police in the area.

Protesters contended that farmers around the region are suffering as a result of rising taxes and social charges. The cost of living has risen nationwide and this is in addition to the tax increases and other levies, other expenses include rising fuel and animal feed prices.

Farmers in other parts of the neighbourhood set out to destroy manure in the parking lots of big suburban supermarkets. According to the farmers, a lot of large grocery chains won’t provide their produce at fair prices. The development came after multiple demonstrations in the area in November of last year when farmers expressed fear for their livelihoods.

Earlier, German farmers began a week-long statewide agitation on 8th January by clogging roadways and major highways in almost all 16 Federal states of Germany with thousands of tractors and trucks. There have been reports of blockades in Bavaria, Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Baden-Württemberg. Notably, the administration has reversed its prior plan to eliminate diesel subsidy reduction, yet the protests have persisted.

The convoys also stopped production at a Volkswagen auto plant in the city of Emden in northwest Germany, bringing thousands of tractors and trucks with them. The staff were unable to report to work due to the roadblock. The blockade in the northern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania received backing from haulage companies protesting against the increase in lorry tolls. Reports highlighted that thousands of participants carried banners with the words “No farmer, no future” as they gathered in front of Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate.

Farmers protests rock Europe

Tractor columns have been obstructing roads in Germany, causing traffic jams and hassles for commuters. The most intense pushback has been in the Netherlands, where government efforts to dismantle farms and reduce the number of animals on them have been met with violent and ongoing protests following a 2019 court ruling on nitrogen emissions. Similar brawls in Belgium resulted in tractor convoys jamming Brussels’ European Union district in March of the previous year. Dairy farmers in Ireland, where there have been fewer demonstrations, marched last month with their cows to the offices of three government officials in protest of the nitrogen restrictions.

Following the government’s announcement in January 2023 that it would limit the amount of water farmers may extract from the drought-stricken Tagus river, farmers protested in Madrid’s streets following the country’s warmest year ever. French farmers protesting a ban on pesticides drove tractors through Paris the following month.

The German government softened a plan to reduce subsidies for diesel in farmyard vehicles after incensed farmers dumped manure on Berlin streets in December. However, advocacy groups are pressuring them to abandon the idea completely. The German Farmers’ Association President, Joachim Rukwied, announced that 100,000 tractors had taken to the streets for a week of disruptive protests. “Farmers today sent a clear signal to the federal government to completely withdraw the planned tax increases.”

The cost of having to pay for more of their pollution is too much for some farmers, who are already trying to make ends meet in the wake of the energy crisis and epidemic. Some complained that they are devalued by city people who eat the food they raise without understanding its source and that they are burdened by excessive regulations. Farmers in agricultural superpowers like the Netherlands and France have voiced their dissatisfaction with government pressure to reduce production after years of encouragement to increase it."

A statement issued by the ministry said that this has led to production/ sales of Rs. 8.61 lakh crore and employment generation (direct & indirect) of over 6.78 lakhs. PLI Schemes have witnessed exports surpassing Rs. 3.20 lakh crore, with significant contributions from sectors such as Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Food Processing, and Telecom & Networking products.

As on date, 746 applications have been approved in 14 Sectors with expected investment of over Rs. 3 lakh crore, the ministry informed. 176 MSMEs are among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Pharma, Telecom, White Goods, Food Processing, Textiles & Drones. Several MSMEs are serving as investment partners/ contract manufacturers for large Corporates.

Incentive amount of around Rs. 4,415 crore has been disbursed under PLI Schemes for 8 Sectors -Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing (LSEM), IT Hardware, Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom & Networking Products, Food Processing and Drones & Drone Components.

As a result of the PLI scheme, manufacturing of various electronic components like battery, chargers, PCBA, PCB, camera modules, passive components and certain mechanics have been localized in the country. This has also caused green shoots in the component ecosystem wherein large companies such as TATAs have entered into component manufacturing.

PLI beneficiaries account for around 20% of the market share only, however, have contributed to nearly 82% mobile phones exports during FY 2022-23. Production of mobile phones increased by more than 125% and export of Mobile Phones increased around 4 times since FY 2020-21. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increased by ~254% since the inception of the PLI scheme for LSEM.

Due to the PLI Scheme, there has been a significant reduction in imports of raw materials in the Pharma sector. Unique intermediate materials and bulk drugs are being manufactured in India including Penicillin-G. Production of 39 Medical Devices have commenced such as CT-Scan, Linear Accelerator (LINAC), Rotational Cobalt Machine, C-Arm, MRI, Cath Lab, Ultrasonography, Dialysis Machine, Heart Valves, Stents, etc.

Import substitution of 60% has been achieved in the Telecom sector and sales of Telecom & Networking Products by PLI beneficiary companies in FY 2023-24 increased by 370% vis-a-vis Base Year (FY 2019-20). Significant impact on investment in the Drone industry with a CAGR of 90.74%.

Under the PLI Scheme for Food Processing, sourcing of raw materials from India has seen significant increase which has positively impacted income of Indian farmers and MSMEs. Sales of Organic Products increased and Indian brand visibility enhanced in the international market through Branding & Marketing abroad. The Scheme has also led to increased Millet procurement – from 668 MT (FY 20-21) to 3,703 MT (FY 22-23).

Keeping in view India’s vision of becoming ‘Atmanirbhar’, PLI Schemes for 14 key sectors [with an incentive outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore (over US$26 billion)] are under implementation to enhance India’s Manufacturing capabilities and Exports.

PLI Scheme across these key specific sectors has started to make Indian manufacturers globally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiencies; create economies of scale; enhance exports and make India an integral part of the global value chain.

PLI Schemes have transformed India’s exports basket from traditional commodities to high value-added products such as electronics & telecommunication goods, processed food products etc."

The video dates back to May 2022, days after the Shivling was discovered in the Gyanvapi structure. “Temples in Varanasi and Mathura were demolished by Aurangzeb,” he stated as he further questioned the government over the demolition of the disputed structure. “Can the government demolish something that was built in 1670?” he said.

“It is correct that Aurangzeb demolished the temple but it is not specified that it was Lord Shiva’s temple. It became a Shiv Temple after they found a Shivling. Aurangzeb demolished this temple in Varanasi. Another temple was demolished in Mathura. There’s no two ways about it. The question is can the government demolish something that was built in 1670? It is against India’s Monument Protection Act,” he was quoted as saying.

The video was shared by Journalist Abhijeet Majumder who hinted that Gyanvapi, Krishna Janmasthan, and Mathura must be returned to their rightful custodians.

Hindu temples demolished by Mughals

It is important to note that several temples in India were demolished by the Mughals to establish their rule over the country and build Mosques instead. The Ram Mandir also has a similar history which dates back to 492 years. The temple believed to have been demolished by the Mughal tyrant Babar in 1528, has been at the centre of a historical and spiritual quest for centuries. This quest, deeply embedded in the hearts of millions, has seen countless devotees laying down their lives for the cause. Today the temple is being built and every Hindu devotee is looking forward to the ceremony of Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha scheduled on 22nd January in Ayodhya.

Also, the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi had stood tall for centuries before becoming an eye sour for the Mughals. The Islamic rulers, who were on a mission to destroy anything that was against Islam, saw Kashi Vishwanath Dham as one of the main targets challenging the supremacy of their faith.

On April 18, 1669, Islamic ruler Aurangzeb gave the order to demolish Kashi Vishwanath Temple. In his order, he had written that the temple was the place where “the foolish Pundits teach evil knowledge from junk books.” On the explicit orders from Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Kashi Vishwanath Dham, one of the holiest Hindu sites of pilgrimage, was plundered, desecrated, demolished, and converted into Gyanvapi Mosque in 1669.

Further, after the Ram Mandir verdict, the Krishna Janmabhoomi Nirman Nyas is hoping to reclaim the four-and-a-half-acre land next to the mosque to use it as a ‘Ranga Manch’ for religious and cultural functions organized by it and the temple authorities.

Ever since the Babri mosque was demolished in 1992, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) has been calling for the ‘liberation’ of Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura and the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi.

Following the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi case, there has been a growing demand among Hindus to reclaim Kashi and Mathura, along with Ayodhya. Taking back the disputed sites of Kashi Vishwanath temple and Krishna Janmabhoomi temple at Mathura has now become a priority for various Hindu groups in the country.

Places of Worship Act – a major hurdle

However, the major roadblock for the Hindus to reclaim its spiritual and cultural sites that have been lost due to Islamic conquest in the past comes in the form of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which was passed by the then PV Narasimha Rao government. The controversial law prohibits the conversion of places of worship, like churches, mosques, and temples, into places of worship of a different religion.

Section 4 of the Act claims to preserve the “religious character” of a place of worship, as it existed on August 15, 1947. It also says that any court proceeding regarding any such conversion would cease after the Act came into force.

However, there was a relaxation in the law concerning the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute as Section 5 of the Act specifically mandated an exemption to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute under the law and its court proceedings.

‘Historian’ Irfan Habib’s statements against RSS, PM Modi

It is worth mentioning that Marxist ‘Historian’ Irfan Habib has always praised the Mughals and criticized the Hindu community. He has also time and again criticized the BJP government for making changes to the history of the NCERT syllabus. In an exclusive interview with NewsClick the ‘historian’ had criticized the Hindu outfits saying that Mughals would not disappear from history just because Sangh wished so.

Also, in the year 2020, Habib said that in Aligarh Muslim University RSS was formed to attack Muslims and that the Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar was responsible for the partition of the country, extenuating Mohammad Ali Jinnah who propounded the two-nation theory.

Habib had also said that there is strong circumstantial evidence that Savarkar was involved in the murder of Mahatma Gandhi, and referred to PM Modi as ‘Jahil’.

Notably, Author Meenakshi Jain, in an interview with Open Magazine, asserted that leftist historian Irfan Habib was among the pro-Babri group who tried to discredit in vain an inscription that fell from the walls of the Babri structure during its demolition in 1992. The inscription said it was built for the person who destroyed the 10-headed Ravan."

The idol is covered in a cloth. The idol of Shri Ram Lalla has been carved in black stone by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj and weights around 150-200 kg.

Arun Yogiraj from Mysore has used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol. Reportedly, Lord Ram has been depicted in the Bal Swaroop (five-year-old child).

Krishna Shila is found in the vicinity of Karkala, a small town in Karnataka, approximately 60 kilometers away from Mangalore. According to the officials, the most attractive and durable sculptures are made with Krishna Shila as it is one of the finest stones used for sculpting.

The idol reached the Ram Mandir with a procession that made a brief stop at the Hanumangarhi temple in Ayodhya. The idol will be placed inside the sanctum sanctorum today (18th January) as part of the second day of the week-long rituals leading to the Pran Pratishtha on 22nd January.

As per reports, a silver idol of Shri Ram Lalla did a round of the Ram Mandir premises on Wednesday evening garlanded with roses and marigolds. A kalash puja was also performed.

Two other idols were also sculpted for the grand consecration ceremony and now they will be placed in the temple at separate locations."

A video of passengers eating on the tarmac at the Airport had gone viral. Additionally, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakhs on the Mumbai Airport.

The action was taken in connection to this case after the regulatory authority received a dissatisfactory reply from the CSMI Airport to the show cause notice. The CSMI Airport failed to abide by the prescribed safety requirements. Notably, on 15th January, passengers were seen sitting on the airport’s tarmac and having dinner after facing a delay of over 12 hours for an IndiGo flight. Air India and SpiceJet were also penalised for violating norms.

Why was Airport fined?

The BCAS has imposed a penalty of Rs 1.2 Crore on IndiGo. The DGCA penalised the Mumbai Airport for Rs 30 lakhs while the BCAS imposed a fine of Rs 60 lakhs on the airport raising the fine amount to Rs 90 lakhs. On Wednesday, show cause notices were issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to both IndiGo and Mumbai Airport following the viral circulation of a video depicting passengers sitting on the tarmac and having meals. In this notice, the ministry said, “If replies are not received in the given time, then enforcement action, including financial penalty, will be initiated.” As the responses received to this notice were dissatisfactory, the authorities imposed the fine.

The ministry attributed responsibility to both Mumbai Airport and IndiGo for the incident. It accused them of not being “proactive in anticipating the situation and making the appropriate facilitation arrangements for passengers at the airport.” The notice further read, “The aircraft was allotted a remote bay C-33 (instead of a Contact Stand – an aircraft parking stand that is suitable for walking passengers to and from an aircraft from an allocated boarding gate), which further added to passenger woes and deprived them the opportunity to avail basic facilities like restrooms and refreshments at the terminal.”

Why was the IndiGo fined?

The ministry additionally stated that the flight operation occurred without considering “passenger convenience, laid down security norms, and operational issues.” In the show cause notice served to IndiGo, the authorities said, “Indigo allowed disembarkation of passengers from flight 6E 2195 onto the apron and then boarded them on to flight 6E 2091 on 15.01.2024 at Mumbai airport, without following the procedure of security screening, which violates the above-mentioned orders. Further, the incident was not reported to BCAS (Bureau of Civil Aviation Security) by the aircraft operator, which is attributed to a violation of Rule 51 of the Aircraft (Security) Rules, 2023.”

IndiGo previously announced conducting an internal inquiry into the incident. Following the imposition of the substantial fine, the airline has yet to respond. In a statement, IndiGo stated, “The Airport Security Group (ASG) of Mumbai was also not forewarned about the situation.” The video of this incident came hours after a clip of a cabin crew being assaulted by a passenger over the delay in take-off had gone viral on the internet. Now the DGCA and BCAS have fined the Mumbai Airport and the IndiGo Airline involved in this incident.

Not only IndiGo, but SpiceJet and Air India were also fined

DGCA has also imposed a fine on SpiceJet and Air India. Both have been asked to pay Rs 30 lakh each. Their flights were delayed due to fog in Delhi. They were not prepared for fog, due to which the DGCA has fined them. These airlines are alleged to have not deployed CAT III trained pilots on duty during foggy days. CAT III certified pilots are trained to fly flights even in low light."

Quoting multiple Pakistani sources, India Today reported that Pakistan has launched air strikes, hitting multiple ‘militant’ targets within Iranian territory. Terming Iranian missile attacks on terrorist locations in Pakistan as an “illegal act”, Pakistan claimed it has the right to respond to such attacks.

Terror attack in Iran

Soon after Iran attacked terror organisations in Pakistan, an army official was reportedly shot dead by terrorists in Iran. The incident occurred in southeastern Iran, next to Pakistan and Afghanistan. As per reports, the deceased official was part of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. The investigating agencies in Iran are attempting to apprehend the culprits behind the attack.

Pakistan condemned the Iranian attack on its soil

Notably, Pakistan condemned Iran for the missile and drone strike in Pakistani territories. Two children were reportedly dead, and three others were injured in the strikes. Pakistan called it an “unprovoked violation” of its sovereignty and airspace. India’s hostile neighbour further claimed that the Iranian attack was against international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter.

India called it a matter between Iran and Pakistan

Replying to a media query on the Iran-Pakistan conflict, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Randhir Jaiswal, said, “This is a matter between Iran and Pakistan. Insofar as India is concerned, we have an uncompromising position of zero tolerance towards terrorism. We understand actions that countries take in their self-defense.”

Iran admitted to strikes in Pakistan

Iranian foreign minister admitted to missile and drone strikes in Pakistani territory. On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Iran’s FM Hossein Amir-Abdollahain said the strikes in Pakistan targeted an “Iranian terrorist group”, and that the Tehran government had asked Pakistan several times to take action on the group. “The so-called Jaish al-Adl group, which is an Iranian terrorist group, was targeted,” he said.

Pakistan expelled Tehran’s envoy

Following the attack, Pakistan expelled the Tehran envoy and recalled its ambassador. “Pakistan has decided to recall its ambassador from Iran and that the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan, who is currently visiting Iran, may not return for the time being,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said while addressing a press briefing in Islamabad.

“Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act, and the responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran,” Baloch said, adding that Islamabad had conveyed the message to the Iranian government.

Iran attacked terror group in Pakistan

On 16th January, Iran attacked the headquarters of a terrorist group with drones and missiles inside Pakistan’s territorial borders, as per reports. Two important headquarters of Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) in Pakistan were destroyed, Al Arabiya News reported, citing Tasnim News Agency.

The strikes were concentrated in an area in Pakistan’s Balochistan where “one of the largest headquarters” of Jaish al-Adl was located, the report said.

Formed in 2012, Jaish al-Adl, designated as a “terrorist” organisation by Iran, is a Sunni terrorist group that operates in Iran’s southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, Al Arabiya News reported. Over the years, Jaish al-Adl has launched numerous attacks on Iranian security forces. In December, Jaish al-Adl took responsibility for an attack on a police station in Sistan-Baluchistan that claimed the lives of at least 11 police personnel, according to Al Arabiya News reported."

While the Houthis claimed they fired missiles at the “Genco Picardy” bulk carrier, ending in a “direct hit,” the US military said the vessel was struck by a drone on Wednesday evening.

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) security agency said that a drone struck a vessel in the Gulf of Aden immediately after the Houthis threatened more assaults on vessels. Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman, said the group’s naval forces hit a US ship dubbed the Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden with “a number of appropriate missiles”.

In televised statements, Sarea vowed that the group would continue its attacks in self-defence and support of Palestinians in Gaza in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. He added that the attack was a response to “the American-British aggression against our country”.

Taking to X, UKMTO said that a “vessel has been hit on the port side by an Uncrewed Aerial System”.

In another post, UKMTO informed that a fire on board had been extinguished and the “vessel and crew are safe”.

In an X post, US Central Command informed that they had conducted strikes on 14 Iran-backed Houthi missiles that were ready to fire in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen on 17th January at around 11:59 pm.

“…These missiles on launch rails presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time, prompting U.S. forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves. These strikes, along with other actions we have taken, will degrade the Houthi’s capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden,” US Central Command posted.

US re-designates Houthis as a terrorist organisation

On January 17th, the US government relisted Houthis as a “specially designated global terrorist” group in response to a series of attacks launched by Houthi terrorists on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Houthis’ continuous targeting of commercial ships, including that of the US, triggered the country to launch counterattacks.

As reported earlier, the United States and the United Kingdom have targeted more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen after the Iran-backed group attacked 27 commercial vessels in the Red Sea. On Monday (16th January), a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile hit a US-owned and operated cargo ship.

On Wednesday, US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan said that the “unprecedented attacks against United States military forces and international maritime vessels operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. These attacks fit the textbook definition of terrorism.”

“Today, in response to these continuing threats and attacks, the United States announced the designation of Ansarallah, also known as the Houthis, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. This designation is an important tool to impede terrorist funding to the Houthis, further restrict their access to financial markets, and hold them accountable for their actions,” Sullivan said.

However, Sullivan added that the US would re-evaluate the SDGT designation of Houthis if the group stops its attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

Notably, the Houthis have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen’s government. The govt is getting help from a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but the Houthis enjoy domestic support and the assistance of Iran and Hezbollah. They declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led “axis of resistance” against Israel, the US and the wider West. It considers itself to be an ally of Hamas and Hezbollah."

The incident occurred in Patna on Tuesday (16th January), and the official, named Arvind Kumar Singh, was taken to Delhi for further treatment.

Tanuj Yadav and Nayan Yadav, sons of RJD leader Nagendra have been identified as the accused in this case. The victim Arvind Singh is from Gopalganj district and works as an executive officer for the state government.

Singh has been reported to have suffered major eye injuries as well as multiple other wounds. However, authorities blamed the event on driving rage between the two parties.

Vijay Kumar Singh, the victim’s brother and an eyewitness in the case, stated that his brother Arvind had come to Patna for personal reasons.

बिहार की राजधानी पटना में उप नगर आयुक्त पर जानलेवा हमला हुआ है। जानलेवा हमला करने वाले नशे में धुत थे। आरोप है कि हमलावरों में एक खुद का नाम तनुज यादव बता रहा था। वह कह रहा था कि नागेंद्र यादव का बेटा हूं, जो उखाड़ना होगा उखाड़ लेना। pic.twitter.com/GRQIrBgQA0 — NBT Bihar (@NBTBihar) January 17, 2024

Vijay stated that he and his brother were on their way to the Boring Road area when some men stopped their car and started asking for their car keys. The miscreants assaulted Arvind with an iron rod as he attempted to intervene.

Vijay stated that the person who assaulted his brother was saying that he is the son of Nagendra Yadav. As per media reports, Nagendra Yadav is a RJD leader and a relative of RJD supremo Lalu Yadav. However, A report in Live Hindustan mentions quoting RJD sources that Nagendra Yadav has no family relations with Lalu Yadav.

“We were on the way from Gola Road to our Boring Canal Road residence around 9.20 p.m. on Tuesday when goons stopped our SUV and hit its bonnet. When my brother Arvind Kumar Singh stepped down from the SUV to talk, they attacked him with iron rods. All the accused were in an inebriated condition at the time of the incident. One of the attackers revealed his name as Tanuj Yadav, son of Nagendra Yadav, and that Lalu Prasad Yadav was his grandfather and we could do whatever we wanted,” the victim’s brother Vijay Singh said.

The victim has attained severe injuries on his head and his eyes. He is undergoing treatment at the hospital.

Confirming the incident, Danapur ASP Abhinav Dheeman said, “We received information about a brawl taking place at Gola road under Rupaspur police station. Our team immediately went there. One of the persons named Arvind Kumar Singh, who tried to intervene in the matter, was brutally assaulted by the goons. He was critically injured in this attack. He was taken to Paras Hospital where doctors referred him to New Delhi for better treatment. We have registered an FIR and are making efforts to identify and arrest the accused.”

Reports stated that Tanuj Yadav and his brother Nayan Yadav, along with a dozen other people have been booked by the police for involvement in the assault."

ED had issued a summons to Kejriwal on 13th January, asking him to appear before it in connection with its probe into the money laundering allegations related to the Delhi excise policy case.

According to an official in the chief minister’s office, the Aam Aadmi Party leader is unlikely to attend ED’s summons because he is slated to visit Goa to meet with party workers and assess Lok Sabha election preparations. In response to a query from reporters at an event on Wednesday, Kejriwal replied, “We will act per the law.”

The Delhi Chief Minister had earlier skipped questioning on January 3 for the third time, claiming that the summons issued by the investigation agency were “illegal” and “politically motivated,” with the sole intent of arresting him.

Kejriwal had previously refused to appear before the investigation agency on two occasions, on November 2 and December 21, opting instead to campaign for assembly elections and attend a 10-day Vipassana meditation camp on the two respective occasions.

It is worth recalling that the initial summons was issued to CM Kejriwal in October of last year as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged money laundering related to the Delhi government’s liquor policy, which was withdrawn in July 2023 over allegations of corruption. Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh, both AAP leaders, were arrested in connection with the same scam by central probe agencies.

Delhi Excise Policy Scam

ED filed its first chargesheet in the case in 2022. The agency said it has so far undertaken over 200 search operations in this case following an FIR after taking cognisance of a CBI case that was registered on the recommendation of the Delhi lieutenant governor. The CBI inquiry was recommended based on the findings of the Delhi Chief Secretary’s report filed in July showing prima facie violations of the GNCTD Act 1991, Transaction of Business Rules (ToBR) 1993, Delhi Excise Act 2009, and Delhi Excise Rules 2010.

The liquor policy for 2021-22 was put into effect by the Delhi administration on 17th November 2021, however, it was cancelled at the end of September 2022 due to accusations of corruption. According to the agencies, the new regulation led to monopolisation and gave economic advantages to people who weren’t eligible for liquor licenses. Meanwhile, Manish Sisodia and the Delhi administration have denied any wrongdoing.

The now-scrapped excise regime, according to the ED, extended an incredibly high 12% profit margin for wholesalers and nearly 185% profit margin for retailers. Further, favours were extended through cartelisation."

Foxconn, through its subsidiary Foxconn Hon Hai Technology India Mega Development Private Limited, is set to invest $37.2 million, securing a substantial 40% stake in the joint venture, as revealed in a regulatory filing to the Taiwanese stock exchanges.

The collaboration aligning with the Indian government’s ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ vision was confirmed on Wednesday (17th January).

The partnership intends to contribute to building a resilient supply chain ecosystem for the domestic semiconductor industry. Foxconn, a global leader in electronics manufacturing and assembler of iPhones, aims to deploy its ‘Build-Operate-Localize’ (BOL) model to support local communities in India.

A spokesperson for HCL Group stated, “HCL Group plans to partner with Foxconn Group to establish OSAT operations in India. HCL Group has a strong engineering and manufacturing heritage, and this is an opportunity that provides strategic adjacency to the Group portfolio.”

This partnership aligns with India’s broader semiconductor ambitions, marked by other proposals in the sector.

Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar recently revealed that the government has received nine proposals for various semiconductor fabrication units, including OSAT facilities. The interest in semiconductor manufacturing in India has surged, with US-based Micron Technology announcing an $825 million investment in assembly, testing, monitoring, and packaging (ATMP) plans in Gujarat.

Despite being characterised as a non-binding memorandum of understanding, officials expect an investment ranging between $100 million to $150 million, subject to further negotiations. The intricate details, including transaction amount, asset particulars, and conditions, will be disclosed upon reaching a definitive agreement.

The proposal is currently under consideration by the India Semiconductor Mission, and industry insiders note the significance of HCL’s expertise in semiconductor design and testing software. The joint venture holds potential, with HCL’s existing partnerships with major chipmakers and Foxconn’s instrumentation expertise.

Foxconn’s expanding presence in India can be attributed to geopolitical tensions and its eagerness to diversify its operations amid global uncertainties. The company, contributing 68% of total iPhone production in India, received approval for an additional $1 billion investment in a new plant for manufacturing Apple products in Bengaluru.

Foxconn and Vedanta mutually parted ways

Earlier, on 10th July 2023, Foxconn stated that it had terminated its USD 19.5 billion joint venture deal with mining baron Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. Reportedly, the venture faced difficulties in securing a technology partner to manufacture chips that are used in mobile phones, refrigerators, and cars. Rumours spread after this decision that Foxconn is leaving India. But the company has expanded its presence in India in the following months and this new OSAT establishment is now announced."

The Mumbai Cyber Police were alerted to the phoney clip by him after which the action was undertaken.

West Region Cyber Police lodged an official complaint under sections 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and 66A (criminalises the sending of offensive messages through a computer or other communication devices) of the Information Technology Act against a gaming website and a Facebook page following a complaint from Sachin Tendulkar’s personal assistant Ramesh Pardhe.

According to the submission, Ramesh Pardhe discovered that a previously recorded interview of Sachin Tendulkar with a media person, available on YouTube, had been altered and shared on the Hurma Facebook page. He further mentioned that the video which mimicked Tendulkar’s voice and movements using deepfake technology was also uploaded on the Skyward Aviator Quest gaming website.

“The visuals are from an old interview that Tendulkar gave to journalist Vikram Sathye. The audio seems to have been superimposed on the video using deep fake technology to make it sound authentic,” Ramesh Pardhe mentioned pointing out that the video claimed Sara Tendulkar won Rs 1.8 lakh a day by using the app to play games.

“We have sought details about the owner of the gaming portal. Usually, servers of these portals are located out of India and platforms are not too keen to share data swiftly,” informed an officer.

On 15th January, the cricketing legend used social media to address the alarming misuse of technology. He shared a deepfake video in which he was seen endorsing a gaming app and even advocating for its ability to help people earn money. He also urged people to be vigilant and take immediate measures against the spread of false information.

The 50-year-old cricketing legend expressed concerns about the issues brought about by the deceptive use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for photo and video editing and highlighted, “These videos are fake. It is disturbing to see rampant misuse of technology. Request everyone to report videos, ads & apps like these in large numbers. Social Media platforms need to be alert and responsive to complaints. Swift action from their end is crucial to stopping the spread of misinformation and deepfakes.”

India’s Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, responded to the post made by Sachin Tendulkar and said that the government will soon announce stricter regulations outlined in the Information Technology Act.

Notably, this is not an isolated instance. The malicious production and distribution of deepfake content, which frequently contains pornographic material, has grown to be effective as a tool for defamation of character and blackmail in recent years. Actors Katrina Kaif, Alia Bhatt, and Priyanka Chopra are among the famous people who have recently become victims of this deepfake threat. The severity of the issue first came to the fore after actress Rashmika Mandana highlighted how she fell victim to this targeted abuse.

Sara Tendulkar also brought up the matter when her altered photo with Shubman Gill also became viral on social media during the ICC Men’s World Cup 2023."

One of the arrested accused is identified as Zaheer Khan. He is a 22-year-old street vendor. The arrest of the accused came after Hindus held a massive protest in front of the Mulbagal Town police station.

A meticulous review of CCTV footage within the vicinity helped the police identify the accused. The recorded visuals distinctly captured the arrested individual Zaheer Khan cutting the banner with a sharp object at approximately 10:45 pm on Tuesday. These banners were erected to mark the celebration of the Makara Sankranti festival and the upcoming consecration ceremony at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

On Wednesday morning, members from Hindu organisations congregated protesting and vehemently demanding action against the miscreants. Kolar BJP MP S Muniswamy and Mulbagal JD(S) MLA Samruddhi V Manjunath visited the village. Police personnel were deployed in the area to control the situation. Subsequently, the Mulbagal Town Police authorities meticulously examined the CCTV footage, leading to the arrest of Zaheer Khan.

A police officer said, “The banners were put up for the Ram Mandir inauguration in Ayodhya and also for the Sankranti festival. Around 10.45 pm on Tuesday, Zaheer used sharp objects to cut the banners in Jahangir Mohalla and Gungunte Palya villages.”

Kolar MP S Muniswamy said, “The police have arrested two people tearing banners of lord Sri Ram. An investigation should be conducted to find out who is supporting these miscreants to indulge in such activities. Several women were injured after a group of Muslim men threw stones at them when they were going on a procession on a festival day in Malur a few days ago. There is an increase in such incidents in the state after the Congress came to power.”

All education institutes will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh on the day and liquor shops will be closed too.

Other states implementing a holiday for education institutes on the day include Madhya Pradesh, which declared 22nd January a dry day. Goa has declared a holiday for schools and government employees.

In Chhattisgarh, all government and private schools and colleges will remain closed. In Haryana, schools will remain closed and liquor consumption will not be allowed.

Meanwhile, advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay has reportedly written a letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah urging them to declare 22nd January as a national holiday.

Advocate Upadhyay states in the letter that Shri Ram lives in the breath and veins of every Indian across the globe and particularly Hindus. The excerpt of the letter read:

“No personality like Lord Shri Ram has ever been born on this planet in any civilization in the world and Lord Shri Ram is an integral part of national pride and Indian civilization. It is well known that Lord Shri Ram lives in the breath and veins of every Indian across the globe in general and Hindus in particular. It is a well-known fact that Lord Shri Ram is worshipped more than any other incarnation of Lord Vishnu or any other god or goddess. People of the country are awaiting very eagerly to celebrate January 22, 2024, as a national festival and therefore, to respect the sentiment of the people of the country and more particularly, the Hindus, it is desirable that January 22, 2024, be declared a national holiday like other Hindu festivals.”

Meanwhile, weeklong rituals in the run-up to Pran Pratishtha have begun in Ayodhya. On Thursday, the second day of rituals, the idol of Shri Ram Lalla was brought to the sanctum sanctorum of Ram Mandir and is set to be installed.

Political leaders, religious heads, celebrities, VIPs will all be part of the grand ceremony and attendees will be presented with gifts including the soil from the Ram Janmabhoomi.

A team of priests led by Pandit Lakshmikant Dixit will be performing the rituals of Pran Pratishtha in the presence of PM Modi."

Angkita, who was once the head of Assam’s Youth Congress, found herself expelled from the party last year.

As reported by ANI, Angkita Dutta said that she would submit a memorandum to Rahul Gandhi and seek justice.

“I have been in exile for the past 10 months. At that time, I sought justice, but I was suspended from the party. In the last 10 months, I have not joined any party. I was not in Congress, but I worked to strengthen the Congress party. Now people are coming out with me. I will submit a memorandum and we want justice. When he (Rahul Gandhi) reached at Amguri and Assam, I believed that I would also get Nyay. I am hopeful that, he (Rahul Gandhi) will give me Nyay,” she said.

“I come out to seek Nyay (Justice). He has given me a ray of hope. When he started Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, I also saw a ray of hope that I would get Nyay,” she added.

Meanwhile, the fifth day of Congress’ Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra resumed on Thursday from Nagaland’s Tuli to Jorhat in Assam. Rahul Gandhi while addressing the people said that perhaps the most corrupt government in India runs in Assam.

“Today is the fifth day of the ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’. The public is moving forward united with us in this ‘Nyya Yatra’ against the ‘injustice’ spread in the country. This journey will continue… until we get the right to justice,” the Congress posted on X.

Who is Angkita Dutta?

Angkita Dutta is the former head of the Assam Youth Congress. On April 22, 2023, the Congress party expelled the then Assam Pradesh Youth Congress President, Angkita Dutta, from the primary membership of the Congress party for six years for ‘anti-party activities.’

The decision came after she lodged a police complaint against IYC national president Srinivas BV, accusing him of harassment. Before that, on April 20, the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) had issued a show cause notice to Angkita Dutta over the allegations she leveled against IYC National President and Rahul Gandhi’s close aide Srinivas BV.

The Congress’ legal cell had sent a notice to Angkita Dutta after she made the harassment allegations. The notice, sent on behalf of Youth Congress President Srinivas BV, had called Angkita Dutta’s complaint of harassment as “false and frivolous”.

On April 18, 2023, Angkita Dutta had posted a series of tweets wherein she opened up about facing harassment at the hands of Congress leader Srinivas BV and also accused the Congress high command of a lack of interest in her case. In her subsequent police complaint, Dutta had narrated that she had been facing harassment and mental trauma at the hands of BV Srinivas for several months.

He described his experience of being trapped in the restroom of the Mumbai-Bengaluru flight with the words horrified, panicked, and suffocated. He was eventually rescued and was reportedly the last person to de-board the plane.

After being rescued from the lavatory 20 minutes after arriving at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), he disclosed that he was given a bottle of water and an apology but no medical attention, not even an assessment of his blood pressure. “I was traumatised, dazed and injured as I was thrown around inside the toilet as the plane landed in Bengaluru. There was no medical assistance at all,” he said.

The passenger intends to file a complaint with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and sue the airline for endangering his life. He added that SpiceJet offered him a Rs 5,000 coupon as compensation but he declined. However, the airline said that the staff “provided assistance and guidance” to the passenger.

The Koramangala resident, who was allotted seat 14D in the plane, mentioned, “Soon after the flight took off at 2.10 AM on Tuesday, I went to use the lavatory on the front left side of the plane. Within minutes, I realised something was wrong with the lock and I tried to open it. I managed to draw the attention of the crew, who tried to open the door. It was getting scarier every minute.”

The techie highlighted, “During landing, I was thrown around and suffered injuries. It took 20 minutes for someone to start breaking open the door. When I came out, I had bruises, and my vision was blurred for a while. But I received no medical help even after coming out of the lavatory. I got a bottle of water and some apologies from SpiceJet.”

A ground staff divulged, “The plane landed at KIA at 3.42 AM. An aircraft engineer boarded the flight after all passengers disembarked. The passenger was still trapped inside the cramped toilet. The landing was horrific as he was seated on the commode.”

The 37-year-old software engineer documented the event with a video showing himself confined inside the restroom and struggling to open the door. Now, the footage of the passenger fumbling to open the door has gone viral. He can be observed sitting on the toilet’s lid before getting to his feet and attempting to open the door in the short clip. The latch appeared to be unlocked in the video, however, the door is jammed. Someone from outside also tries to move the door knob to open it but to no avail. The mirror reflected his fleeting glance as he panned the camera around.

STORY | SpiceJet passenger gets stuck in aircraft lavatory mid-air; crew member sends 'do not panic' message

The Bangalore-based software engineer was travelling back to the IT hub on SpiceJet’s SG-268 Boeing 737-8 aircraft from Mumbai where he had visited family. The aircraft was supposed to depart Mumbai at 10:45 PM, but it didn’t take off until 2 in the morning.

Once on board, he proceeded to the restroom when the seat belt sign was turned off. He laboured for more than twenty minutes to catch the attention of the in-flight personnel when he was unable to open the toilet door. He eventually got them to notice, but by then the air pressure had caused the door to jam further and the team was unable to unlock it.

The passenger couldn’t hear the in-flight attendants trying to talk to him at first and moved himself closer to the door in an anxious state so he could hear their directions. “Sir, we tried our best to open the door; however, we could not. Do not panic. We are landing in a few minutes, so please close the commode lid and sit on it and secure yourself. As soon as the main door is open, an engineer will come,” read a note handed over to him by a cabin crew member through the cracks in the folding door of the loo.

The crew had instructed the passenger to settle down on the commode and hold on tight but the force of the landing had been so intense that the person was flung to one side without a proper seat belt and sustained injuries.

One employee who saw the rescue remarked, “He told us how he struggled inside the toilet, which had constricted space and the panic of being locked for hours. He was quite shaken up and dazed when he stepped out of the toilet. He could hardly manage to walk.”

He reportedly requested to meet with a senior SpiceJet official to file a formal complaint, but the staff instead put him in a cab and sent him home. A bottle of water was given to him and a car was provided to drive him to his place.

According to a close friend of the passenger who asked to remain anonymous, SpiceJet staff failed to take him to the closest hospital for a check-up despite the seriousness of the event. He revealed, “We had to take him to a hospital ourselves. We are looking at filing a formal complaint against the airline.”

His cousin also posted a message on social media about the passenger’s ordeal which stated, “After flight took off, he went to rest room and after that he was locked for almost 2 hours. Had to suffer a lot inside the room, it was really suffocating and was hard to breathe. He had breathing issues while he was locked inside the restroom, moreover, while landing on the flight there was no proper safety as he was stuck in the restroom during that and no one resolved this until the flight landed in Bangalore after which the door was opened with the help of engineer.”

He added, “It seems like he has booked a seat for the toilet, this is really a pathetic way of maintaining the flight and poor maintenance resulted in a traumatised journey which he is suffering now.”

The airline released a statement after the episode which said, “SpiceJet regrets and apologises for the inconvenience caused to the passenger. The passenger is being provided with a full refund. On 16 January, a passenger unfortunately got stuck inside the lavatory for about an hour on the SpiceJet flight operating from Mumbai to Bengaluru, while the aircraft was airborne due to a malfunction in the door lock. Throughout the journey, our crew provided assistance and guidance to the passenger. Upon arrival, an engineer opened the lavatory door, and the passenger received immediate medical support.”"

In an exclusive interview with Satya Hindi’s YouTube channel on 17th January, Raut claimed that Samajwadi Party’s Mulayam Singh contributed to the construction of Ram Mandir as he ordered firing on Kar Sevaks during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, which resulted in the killing of a large number of Ram devotees.

“I believe, Mulayam Singh Yadav also contributed to Ram Mandir. If he hadn’t fired, the Ram Janmabhoom movement wouldn’t have taken a grip. Ram gave everybody the sense at that time and everybody acted accordingly so that the temple could be built today,” Raut could be heard saying after 11 minutes into the video. He said that Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao also contributed to the Ram Mandir movement.

In the interview further, he alleged that BJP was trying to convert the Ram Temple into a political event. “When the Ram Janmabhoomi movement started, there was no political intention in the minds of people. Everybody just wanted the temple to be constructed. People sacrificed their lives for the temple. Some of our members also participated in Kar Seva. But today the picture is only in favor of BJP. It is as if the Ram temple or Ayodhya is BJP’s property,” he said.

Raut added that the ‘construction of Ram Temple’ is the biggest ‘failure’ of PM Modi’s leadership. “Modi government will not talk about Kashmiri Pandits, it will not talk about corruption, it will not talk about employment generation, etc. Ram Mandir is the only agenda that PM Modi has been using to win elections. This is the biggest failure of PM Modi’s leadership that he has to take the support of Ram Mandir to win elections,” Raut added.

Commenting on the controversy involving the Shankaracharyas, Raut said that earlier people believed only in 4 Shankaracharyas, now the 5th one had arrived and that was PM Modi. “Now people believe in PM Modi if they are willing to follow Sanatan Dharma. They don’t pay attention to what the Shakaracharyas are saying,” he stated.

It is important to note that Sringeri Jagadguru Shankaracharya Sri Sri Vidhushekhara Bharati Mahaswamiji on 15th January said that propaganda was being run by a few people claiming that Shankaracharyas were against the Ram Mandir. He asked the Sanatan Dharmis to ignore the propaganda and unitedly recite Lord Ram’s name (Ram naam) and seek the blessings of Shri Ram on 22nd January.

“This is the moment for which Hindus have struggled for the last 500 years. Everybody is happy and satisfied as the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha is taking place in Ayodhya on 22nd January. We all have to unitedly participate in the event and seek blessings of Lord Ram,” he said.

Earlier, on 12th January, top spiritual leaders of Sanatan Hindu Dharma, Jagadguru Shankaracharya Dwarka SharadaPeetham and Sringeri Math had issued statements addressed to Lord Ram devotees regarding the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of the idol of Lord Ram in Ayodhya on 22nd January. They denounced the fallacies disseminated in social media by vested interests and extended their firm support and blessings to the Pran Pratishtha event. They were reacting to claims by Congress leaders and others that four Shankaracharyas in India including the Shankaracharya of Dwarka and Sringeri math have opposed the Pran Pratishtha ceremony and that they are not attending the event.

While the Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath and Puri have indeed said that they will not attend the event, no such announcements were made by Dwarka and Sringeri, but their names were also added to the claims. They have not said that they are opposed to the ceremony, and have not said that the Ram Mandir is incomplete, as claimed by several opposition leaders. Therefore the Dwarka and Sringeri Maths have issued statements refuting such claims, and they urged the devotees to celebrate the inauguration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

Earlier, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Sanjay Raut mocked the Pran Pratishtha event scheduled to take place on 22nd January 2024 in Ayodhya. He called the ceremony a political event and said that the only thing left for the BJP was to announce Lord Ram as their election candidate.

Also, Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Sushma Andhare was booked by Maharashtra Police for insulting and raising questions over Lord Rama, Lord Krishna’s character. “I don’t want a husband like Lord Rama. Who wants a husband like Lord Rama who showed mistrust of his wife and sent her to exile while she was 7 months pregnant? If people raised questions about Goddess Sita’s character for being in Ravana’s captivity for years, why did nobody question Lord Rama’s character? He was also alone in the jungle while she was held hostage, right?” Andhare had said in the speech for which she was booked."

On Wednesday, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Prasanna B Varale and Justice Krishna S Dixit heard Abhishek Gowda’s appeal, issued summons to the respondents to file objections and subsequently adjourned the hearing.

Reports say that petitioner Abhishek Gowda, a resident of Hosa Kabballu village, Kanakapura taluk of Ramanagara district said that the madrasa inside the Jama Masjid in Srirangapatna caused damage to the original structure by making structural modifications, demolishing the compound, building bathrooms, destroying historic sculptures, and cooking and consuming food there daily. The petitioner told the court that the said mosque was constructed during Tipu Sultan’s era.

“All the above acts are totally illegal and a violation of Section 7, Rule 7 & 8 of the Ancient Monuments and Archeological Sites and Remains Act and Rules,” the petitioner said.

The petitioner also contended that the office bearers of the Bajrang Dal and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had asked the government to take action in this regard in 2022 and had filed a police complaint but to no effect. In response to the petitioner’s RTI appeal for information on the madrasa inside the mosque, the ASI stated that no permission was obtained to operate a madrasa within the protected site.

The petitioner sought the court to order the ASI to remove unlawful structures from the mosque and to shut down the illegal madrasa that is operating there. The petitioner filed a court petition after receiving no answer from the Archaeological Survey of India, the state, or the central government."

On this occasion, gifts will be sent from temples across the country. The famous Shri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala will present ‘Onavillu’ as a gift to Lord Rama.

What is Onavillu?

Onavillu is a traditional musical instrument, shaped like a small bow. The Onavillu, which will be sent as a gift to Lord Ram, will also be seen by devotees from Thursday (18th January) morning. The Onavillu will be handed over by the Shri Padmanabhaswamy temple priest and temple administration committee members to the representatives of the Sri Rama Teertha Kshetra Trust at 5.30 pm at a ceremony.

The Padmanabhaswamy Temple, dedicated to Lord Vishnu, holds profound historical significance, as mentioned in the Puranas. According to the Shrimad Bhagwat, the temple has a rich legacy. Lord Ram is also an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Balram is said to have visited the Padmanabhaswamy temple. He also took a bath in the holy lake Padmatheertham here.

According to the police, the preliminary investigation revealed that her former boyfriend killed her before he threw himself in front of a local train and committed suicide.

A suicide note found on the man’s cell phone contained a “code” that the investigators struggled for days to unravel. They eventually succeeded in figuring it out and discovered that it was the number of a tree that forest officials had marked. On 17th January, the code assisted the police in locating the girl’s body. According to an official, the accused, who was upset that the girl had severed her relationship with him, allegedly strangled her to death in the Kharghar Hills.

On 12th December, the girl departed for her college in Sion and never came back, which led to the Kalamboli police station opening a missing person case. The official stated that authorities also initiated another investigation after learning that a resident of Kalamboli named Vaibhav Burungale had committed suicide on 12th December by jumping in front of a local train.

A special task force was established by Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Milind Bharambe to look into the matter. The official added that police recovered a suicide note that was in the man’s cell phone, in which he confessed to killing the woman and planned to end his life.

According to the official, the suicide note contained code terms like “L01-501” which the police deciphered to solve the case. The code corresponded to the number of a Forest Department numbered tree where Vaibhav Burungale had disposed of the victim’s corpse.

A press release by the police read, “The investigation revealed that the woman and Burungale were present in the Kharghar Hills area on December 12. Police took the help of voluntary rescuers from Lonavala and collaborated with the Fire Brigade, Cidco, and Forest Department to search the woman’s body. Drones were also used.”

The uncovering of the woman’s body hidden behind bushes at a wasteland in the Kharghar region’s Owe camp area signified a significant turning point. Her clothes from when she left for college, the ID card and the wristwatch were used to identify the body. Police said that a further investigation is being carried out."

While Pakistan claims to have killed many terrorists in its “intelligence-based operation” named “Marg Bar Sarmachar”, Iran’s news agency IRNA reported that among the seven killed by Pakistan today were three women and four children who were not Iranian citizens.

“Seven people, who did not have Iranian nationality, were killed during Pakistan’s missile attack on the southeastern Iranian city early on Thursday,” IRNA reported citing a provincial security official.

IRNA reported that the strike, which occurred at 04:05 local time (0335 GMT), was directed at an Iranian border settlement, according to Ali Reza Marhamati, the deputy governor-general of Sistan-Baluchestan province in southeast Iran. Marhamati reported that three women and four children were killed in the attack. He went on to explain that another explosion occurred near Saravan with no casualties. Saravan is located 347 km southeast of Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchestan, and shares a border with Pakistan.

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement patting its back for its so-called “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” which killed women and children. “This morning’s action was taken in light of credible intelligence of impending large scale terrorist activities. This action is a manifestation of Pakistan’s unflinching resolve to protect and defend its national security against all threats,” the statement reads.

Furthermore, Pakistan called Iran a “brotherly country” and asserted that it had advocated for dialogue and cooperation to combat terrorism. “Iran is a brotherly country and the people of Pakistan have great respect and attention for the Iranian people. We have always emphasised dialogue and cooperation in confronting common challenges including the menace of terrorism and will continue to endeavour to find joint solutions,” the Foreign Ministry said.

HalVash, an advocacy group for the Baloch people, posted pictures on X that showed the remains of the munitions used in the strike. It stated that several residences in Saravan had been struck. It released videos of a mud-walled building being destroyed and smoke rising after the strike.

Meanwhile, Iranian state television, quoting an anonymous official after the Pakistan strike, said Tehran strongly condemned the attack and “demanded an immediate explanation” from Pakistan.

Iran summons Pakistani ambassador

Iran summoned Pakistan’s charge d’affaires on Thursday after the strike. “Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires to protest against the missile attack from the neighbouring country to a southeastern Iranian village near Saravan on Thursday,” IRNA reported.

Iran strikes Jaish-al-Adl headquarters in Pakistan

As reported earlier, on 16th January, Iran attacked the headquarters of a terrorist group with drones and missiles inside Pakistan’s territorial borders. Two important headquarters of Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) in Pakistan were destroyed. The strikes were concentrated in an area in Pakistan’s Balochistan region where “one of the largest headquarters” of Jaish al-Adl was located.

Following the attack, Pakistan expelled the Tehran envoy and recalled its ambassador. “Pakistan has decided to recall its ambassador from Iran and that the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan, who is currently visiting Iran, may not return for the time being,” Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said while addressing a press briefing in Islamabad.

Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign minister admitted to missile and drone strikes in Pakistani territory. Hossein Amir-Abdollahain said the strikes in Pakistan targeted an “Iranian terrorist group”, and that the Tehran government had asked Pakistan several times to take action on the group.

Notably, Jaish al-Adl, formed in 2012, designated as a “terrorist” organisation by Iran, is a Sunni terrorist group that operates in Iran’s southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan."

Speaking to PTI, Zehra said, “I wrote a Ram Bhajan in the Pahadi language recent which became viral on the internet. I believe that as the consecration ceremony of Ram Temple is nearing Ayodhya, we the people of Jammu and Kashmir should also have contribution in it.”

She further said, “Out L-G is a Hindu but he does not discriminate against us on the basis of religion while carrying out development work. Our Imam Hussain has also taught us that the followers of the Prophet love the country in which they live. Loving one’s country is part of being faithful.”

“Right now I have 1,000 kg rangoli. I will use at least 500 kg today (17th January) and will see the rest tomorrow,” Kumbhar said ending on the note Jai Shri Ram.

It may be noted that earlier in the day, it was reported that five states have declared a holiday on the occasion of Pran Pratishtha on 22nd January. All education institutes will remain closed in Uttar Pradesh on the day and liquor shops will be closed too.

Other states implementing a holiday for education institutes on the day include Madhya Pradesh, which declared 22nd January a dry day. Goa has declared a holiday for schools and government employees.

District Judge AK Vishwesh stated in his judgment on Wednesday that the basement of Vyas ji, located at the southern end of the complex, requires regular maintenance, as stated by Hindu side counsel Madan Mohan Yadav.

“Therefore, district magistrate of Varanasi is appointed receiver of Vyas ji’s basement,” the court said.

Yadav had previously stated that authorities had closed and locked the basement in 1993. Yadav said in his plea that Somnath Vyas, a priest, had previously utilized the basement for worship.

This comes two days after the Supreme Court allowed the cleaning of the ‘wazukhana’ inside the disputed Gyanvapi mosque where the ‘Shivling’ was found on May 16, 2022, during a court-mandated survey. The area of ‘wazukhana’ was sealed in 2022 on a Supreme Court order after the discovery of the Shivling.

On January 2, an application was filed in the Supreme Court by the Hindu petitioners seeking direction from the District Magistrate of Varanasi for cleaning the entire area of ‘wazukhana’ of Gyanvapi mosque where the Shivling was found and maintaining hygienic condition.

The application said fish in the water tank died between December 12 to 25, 2023, and due to the same, a putrid smell emitted from the tank.

It is further submitted that the Committee of Management Anjuman Intezamia Masjid which manages the mosque in the Gyanvapi complex is responsible for the condition of fish due to which they have died."

Former IAF corporal Rajwar Umeshwar Singh, who survived the terror attack that killed four IAF soldiers, identified Malik in court as the principal gunman. Malik watched the court hearings via video from Delhi’s Tihar Jail, where he has been detained since 2019.

Besides the four men murdered, including squadron leader Ravi Khanna, 40 more were injured on January 25, 1990, in Rawalpora, on the outskirts of Srinagar. The IAF employees were waiting for their pickup to the old Srinagar airfield for duty when they came under fire from terrorists.

On the 31st of August 1990, a charge sheet was submitted to the designated TADA Court in Jammu against Malik and five other individuals.

Besides Malik, other accused in the assassination of the IAF personnel are JKLF operators Ali Mohammed Mir, Manzoor Ahmed Sofi alias Mustafa, Javed Ahmed Mir alias ‘Nalka’, Showkat Ahmed Bakshi, Javed Ahmed Zargar, and Nanaji.

“This is an important development in the case. The prosecution witness has identified Malik as the man behind the shooting,” said Senior Public Prosecutor for CBI Monika Kohli.

Kohli is the lead prosecutor in two major cases against Malik: the 1989 kidnapping of Rubaiya Sayeed, the daughter of then-Union Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, and the murder of IAF servicemen.

Malik was offered the opportunity to cross-examine the eyewitness, but he rejected it and has been lobbying for a physical appearance in court."

It read, “It is unfortunate that the PRC (People’s Republic of China) Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson stooped to such low and gutter level talk – resorting to insulting our President and the Filipino nation and further debasing herself, the Ministry, and the Party she represents in the process.”

It added, “But then again, we should not at all be surprised – being a nation and people enjoying the privileges, rights, and freedoms of a democratic society – that an agent of a Party and system of government incompatible with our way of life and who routinely spouts State-sanctioned propaganda and disinformation would go that far and that low. It is unfortunate, but I am, myself, unsurprised. The Spokesperson’s statements were ‘on brand.’ We, and the world, should not expect more.”

""Gutter level talk"", Philippines defence minister slams China after Beijing's provocative comments post Manila's congratulations to Taiwan's Prez elect pic.twitter.com/JUKsqpTqTq — Sidhant Sibal (@sidhant) January 18, 2024

Gilberto Teodoro was responding to Mao Ning’s comments on 16th January advising the Philippines President to “read more books to properly understand the ins and outs of the Taiwan issue” after he had congratulated Lai Ching-te, the winner of the democratically controlled Taiwan’s election and called him president.

The president’s congratulatory statement on 15th January was followed by a statement from his foreign ministry that reiterated the nation’s “One China policy” and emphasised that the message was meant to acknowledge Taiwan’s “mutual interests” with the Philippines, including the 200,000 Filipino workers that are employed there.

However, Beijing’s extremely impolite remarks, cautioning Manila “not to play with fire” are expected to escalate tensions between the two nations who have been at odds over competing territory claims in the South China Sea.

Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed his eagerness to collaborate with Lai Ching-te, a resolute opponent of China and its claims to Taiwan, on social media.

On behalf of the Filipino people, I congratulate President-elect Lai Ching-te on his election as Taiwan's next President.



We look forward to close collaboration, strengthening mutual interests, fostering peace, and ensuring prosperity for our peoples in the years ahead. — Bongbong Marcos (@bongbongmarcos) January 15, 2024

Mao Ning voiced dismay over the remarks and alleged, “The Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposes” the sentiments conveyed by the president while calling on Manila to provide “a responsible explanation.”"

Therefore, kindly accept my resignation from Primary Membership and all other responsibilities of the Aam Aadmi Party.”

He further wrote that as a responsible citizen of this country and having been in active politics since his student days, he has always believed in the Constitution, the Country and the People first. “I will continue to work for the betterment of the state of Haryana, our beloved country Bharat and its People,” he added.

Congress and Aam Aadmi Party had decided to jointly contest the Chandigarh Mayor elections. AAP was going to contest for the Mayor seat while Congress was contesting for Senior Deputy Mayor.

The date of the Chandigarh mayoral elections, which were scheduled to be held today (Thursday), was pushed back citing the “ill health” of the designated presiding officer.

The announcement triggered protests by the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, who had formed an alliance for the mayoral elections. Meanwhile, AAP MP Raghav Chadha also reached the Municipal Corporation Office and while speaking to media personnel, he claimed that BJP wanted the election postponed with fear of defeat.

The murti was transported to the temple site on a truck on Wednesday night, and it was placed on the marble pedestal in the Garbhagriha in the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.

The idol reached the Ram Mandir with a procession that made a brief stop at the Hanumangarhi temple in Ayodhya. The idol of Shri Ram Lalla has been carved in black stone by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj and weighs around 150-200 kg.

As per reports, the idol was placed on the marble asana with religious rituals and chanting of mantras that lasted 4 hours. Sculptor Arun Yogiraj was present during the event. Images from the temple show that a crane was used to transport the idol to the sanctum sanctorum. It is seen that the idol was completely covered.

Although the sculpture has been installed on the asana, it remains a stone statue for now. The black stone sculpture will become an idol only after the Pran Pratishtha or consecration ceremony on 22 January, Monday. Till then, the sculpture will remain fully covered. The eyes of the idol also are blindfolded, which will be removed on Monday. A curtain also has been drawn on the door of the Garbhagriha. Only a select number of priests will perform rituals till the consecration ceremony.

The rituals for Pran Pratishtha started on 16 January, and a different ritual is being held every day till 22nd. As per the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra, the rituals for today included Teerth Poojan, Jal Yatra, and Gandhadhivas.

The 51-inch-tall figure depicts Ram Lalla or lord Ram in his child form, as a five-year-old child. Arun Yogiraj from Mysore has used ‘Krishna Shila’ (black stone) from Karnataka to carve the Ram Lalla idol.

Notably, three sculptors were assigned the task of sculpting the Ram Lalla idol by the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra. They were Ganesh Bhatt and Arun Yogiraj from Karnataka and Satyanarayan Pandey from Jaipur. Two of the idols were made using two stones from Karnataka and one from Rajasthan. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found unsuitable.

After all three idols were completed by the three sculptors in Ayodhya, the one by Arun Yogiraj was unanimously selected on Monday by 11 trustees of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra as the idol that will be placed in the sanctum sanctorum of Ram Mandir. Earlier the trust had said that the other two idols would be placed at prominent places in the temple compound.

The Pram Pratishtha of the idol installed on the mandapa will be during the auspicious ‘Abhijeet Muhurta’ from 12.20 pm to 1 pm on Monday. Starting Tuesday, Kashi-based Vedic scholar and priest Ganeshwar Shastri Dravid will oversee and anchor a team of 121 acharyas tasked with performing the rituals leading to the main event. Laxmikant M Dixit from Kashi has been named as the principal acharya."

Taking to X, Abdul Qahar Balkhi, the Taliban government’s foreign ministry spokesperson said, “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers the recent violence between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan alarming, and calls on the two neighboring countries to exercise restraint.”

Balkhi further asserted that after attaining peace and stability post prolonged “imposed wars” both Iran and Pakistan should make efforts to bolster regional stability and resolve disputes via dialogue and diplomatic means.

“In light of the region’s newfound peace and stability after protracted imposed wars and instability, both sides should direct efforts towards further strengthening regional stability and resolving disputes through diplomatic channels and dialogue,” the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of Islamic Emirates of Afghanistan (IEA) added.

This comes after Pakistan launched “precision military strikes” on 18th January against what it claimed “terrorist hideouts” in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province leaving four children and three women dead in its “intelligence-based operation” named “Marg Bar Sarmachar”. Subsequently, Iran summoned Pakistan’s charge d’affaires to protest against the missile attack.

Pakistan’s ‘precision strike’ came after on 16th January, Iran attacked the headquarters of a terrorist group with drones and missiles inside Pakistan’s territorial borders. Two important headquarters of Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) in Pakistan were destroyed. The strikes were concentrated in an area in Pakistan’s Balochistan region where “one of the largest headquarters” of Jaish al-Adl was located. Following the air strike by Iran, Pakistan expelled the Tehran envoy and recalled its ambassador.

Ironically, the Taliban which is a hardcore Islamist group with a history of violence is calling on other countries to exercise restraint and resolve issues via diplomatic channels. Taliban itself grabbed power in the country after it entered Afghanistan’s capital Kabul in August 2021 overthrowing the democratically elected government there after the US withdrew its forces. Since the Taliban takeover, a Shariah-compliant administration government has been running the country. In addition to the displaced population and extreme poverty, the country witnessed the prohibition of girls from enrolling in schools. Both employment and public life are off-limits to Afghan women.

Interestingly, Pakistan has been the biggest benefactor and cheerleader of the Taliban. Pakistan is one of the only three countries (with UAE and Saudi Arabia) that recognised the Taliban when they first took power in Afghanistan. However, the Afghan Taliban’s success in acquiring power through violence has emboldened the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) which time and again carried out terror activities in Pakistan."

Khan has been charged under appropriate sections of rape under IPC as well as the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act. The matter pertained to the Pardeshipura police station area.

On 14th January, the perpetrator was brought before the court and was subsequently placed under arrest. Meanwhile, Hindu organisations assembled at the police station and held signs while demanding stringent action against the accused. The demonstrations started over the mishandling of the issue.

The victim’s father submitted a written complaint to the police. He stated that the offender entrapped his daughter and brought her to the Oyo Hotel in Pardeshipura where he compelled her to establish a physical relationship with him. He persisted and even filmed an explicit video of her during the time, despite her resistance. He then threatened to make the video viral on social media. Furthermore, he issued death threats to her. The minor girl’s statement was taken in a closed room by cops in the presence of a female police officer.

Her father also divulged that she continued to remain quiet for a long time. He also mentioned that his daughter had not spoken anything in a long time. She remained silent while repeated attempts were made to get her to talk. When another effort was made to speak with her on 13th January, she disclosed that she was friends with a local man named Moin Khan.

The accused picked her up from Pardeshipura and drove her to a hotel in Bicholi Mardana on 17th September which was two months after her birthday. He pushed her against her will into having a sexual affair. He warned her of the serious repercussions when she protested. The accused eventually dropped her home and put further pressure on her to meet him again.

She became confined to her residence as a result of his constant insistence to meet with her and opened up about her alarming situation after receiving counselling. The father informed his acquaintances and launched a complaint after learning of his daughter’s ordeal leading to the registration of the case.

Sub Inspector Kamal Raghuvanshi allegedly did not listen to the family members as they waited for four hours at the police station. However, their plea was heard after a protest by Hindu groups.

The operation, code-named “Marg Bar Sarmachar,” aimed to neutralise terrorists responsible for recent attacks within Pakistan.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), in a statement, emphasised the use of precision strikes, including killer drones, rockets, loitering munitions, and stand-off weapons, with a focus on avoiding collateral damage.

“The precision strikes were carried out using killer drones, rockets, loitering munitions and stand-off weapons. Maximum care was taken to avoid collateral damage,” it said.

The military’s media wing said it identified notorious terrorists utilising the targeted hideouts, including Dosta alias Chairman, Bajjar alias Soghat, Sahil alias Shafaq, Asghar alias Basham, and Wazir alias Wazi.

“Pakistan Armed Forces remain in a perpetual state of readiness to ensure the safety of Pakistani citizens against acts of terrorism,” the statement added.

The ISPR stated that the armed forces’ resolve to ensure that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan are respected and safeguarded against any misadventure remains unwavering.

“We reaffirm our determination to defeat all enemies of Pakistan with the support of the people of Pakistan,” it added.

The operation followed a reported violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran, which launched a strike in Balochistan, resulting in the tragic deaths of two children and the injuries of three girls.

Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed a series of coordinated and targeted military strikes against terrorist hideouts in Sistan-o-Baluchistan province of Iran, under the codename “Marg Bar Sarmachar.”

“This morning, Pakistan undertook a series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes against terrorist hideouts in the Siestan-o-Baluchistan province of Iran,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.

The Foreign Office accused Iran of unprovoked and blatant breaches of Pakistan’s sovereignty, describing it as a violation of international law and the United Nations Charter. Pakistan had previously expressed concerns to Iran about safe havens and sanctuaries for Pakistani-origin terrorists inside Iran. Despite sharing multiple dossiers with concrete evidence, there was a lack of action, allowing these terrorists, known as “Sarmachars,” to continue attacks on innocent Pakistanis.

“Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” FO Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said in a statement on Wednesday.

The military operation was a response to credible intelligence indicating impending large-scale terrorist activities by these groups.

“This morning’s action was taken in light of credible intelligence of impending large-scale terrorist activities by these so-called Sarmachars,” read the statement.

Pakistan asserted its unflinching resolve to protect national security and defended the professionalism of its armed forces in executing the complex operation.

“The successful execution of this highly complex operation is also a testimony to the professionalism of the Pakistan Armed Forces. Pakistan will continue to take all necessary steps to preserve the safety and security of its people, which is sacrosanct, inviolable and sacred,” it added.

While emphasising respect for Iran’s sovereignty, Pakistan clarified that its actions were solely in pursuit of its own security and national interests, which cannot be compromised.

“As a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan upholds the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including the territorial integrity and sovereignty of member states. Guided by these principles and in exercise of our legitimate rights within international law, Pakistan will never allow its sovereignty and territorial integrity to be challenged under any pretext or circumstances,” according to the statement.

Acknowledging Iran as a brotherly country, the Foreign Office stressed the importance of dialogue and cooperation to address common challenges, including terrorism.

“We have always emphasised dialogue and cooperation in confronting common challenges, including the menace of terrorism and will continue to endeavour to find joint solutions.”

Escalating tensions led to Pakistan downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran, expelling the Iranian ambassador, and recalling its envoy from Tehran. Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar cut short his visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos in light of the unfolding developments.

China, a close partner of both Iran and Pakistan, called for restraint and offered to mediate between the two countries. The United States condemned Iran’s actions, accusing Tehran of violating the sovereign borders of three neighbouring countries. Iranian officials reported casualties, including seven individuals without Iranian nationality who were killed during Pakistan’s missile attack.

As tensions escalated, Pakistan initiated strict monitoring of flights from the West, including Iran. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) began monitoring air activities over the western border, directing authorities to stay alert regarding all flights from the west. However, no decision had been made to close Pakistan’s airspace to Iran, Geo News reported.

On Monday (22nd January), the idol of Ram Lalla will be consecrated in the sanctum sanctorum at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There have been countless sacrifices in this struggle that lasted for more than 500 years since the time of invader tyrant Babur.

There are also living witnesses to this struggle, who have suffered more persecution in independent India than during the Mughal period only because they worked for Lord Ram’s cause. Among them are Ramkaran Singh, Harilal Singh, and many other residents of the Sandpur village in the Basti district of Uttar Pradesh. OpIndia visited Ramkaran Singh’s village to gather information about the atrocities committed against him during the Mulayam Singh Yadav’s government in 1990.

Ramkaran Singh is originally a resident of the Sandpur village in the Basti district. On 22nd October 1990, on the information of the presence of Kar Sevaks, the local Dubaulia police station team raided this village. In this raid, the police had also opened fire. Ram Chander Yadav, and Satyawan Singh were martyred at this same time and later Jairaj Yadav was also martyred after a long fight with bullet injuries. Besides firing, the police also registered an FIR and brutally tortured the remaining villagers.

Ramkaran Singh was made the main accused in that FIR. Even today Crime No. 132/90 State Versus Ramkaran Singh is going on in the district court of Basti. When we went to meet Ramkaran Singh in his village, he was at home. He is around 70 years old now. The incident of the year 1990 is etched in his memory as if it happened not 34 years ago but just 34 minutes ago.

Serving Karsevaks was considered a crime

Ramkaran Singh revealed that the sole crime of the residents of Sandpur village was their dedication to assisting Kar Sevaks who had come there from various regions across the country. In Sandpur, a village following the Vedic principle ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’, all the villagers were united in efforts to take Ram Bhakts to Ayodhya safely with proper provisions of their food and shelter. Ramkaran claimed that at that time Mulayam Singh Yadav had instructed to take action against those who gave shelter to the Kar Sevaks. Those who gave shelter to Kar Sevaks were thus treated as criminals. The school was closed and the Dubaulia Inter College was converted into a temporary jail.

Villagers wearing vests were dragged to the police station

Ramkaran Singh elaborated that on 21st October 1990, the SHO of Dubaulia at that time visited Sandpur village and forcefully took Raghvendra Singh, the school manager, from his home while he was seated, dressed only in a lungi and vest. The police station accused Raghvendra Singh of sheltering the Kar Sevaks.

On the way, the police found Ramkaran Singh. He opposed the police and asked them to allow Raghvendra Singh to wear clothes. Listening to this, the police station in-charge started abusing him. The officer said, “If we want to take him naked, he must come with us naked.” It is believed that the police were preparing to torture Raghvendra Singh and reveal information about the halting places of the Kar Sevaks and their secret routes to Ayodhya.

There were orders to catch Ram Bhakts alive or dead

Ramkaran claimed that seeing the opposition of the villagers, the police station in charge then released Raghvendra Singh and went directly to the Superintendent of Police of Basti district. There, the SP instructed the police to catch the villagers who gave shelter to the Ram Bhakts and Karsevaks present in the village dead or alive. For this, the Superintendent of Police also provided additional force to the police station after the order was received from his seniors.

The police team raided at 4 am on 22nd October 1990. Subsequently, women, elderly individuals, and children – anyone encountered – were subjected to brutal beatings by the police. Nevertheless, the villagers had received prior information about the police raid, allowing them to securely relocate the Kar Sevaks outside the village.

The villagers protested the atrocities by the police

Male policemen were deployed to torture the women. In this operation, the forces of PAC, paramilitary and 4 police stations were involved. Ramkaran Singh said that in the early morning, screams of women and children were heard from the Sandpur village. Due to this, people from nearby villages also started gathering.

The police became angry with the protest by the villagers. The police opened fire at villagers. Ram Chander Yadav and Satyawan Singh were martyred on the spot in this firing. Jairaj Yadav and Mahendra Pratap Singh received bullet injuries.

Police robbed women of their jewellery

According to Ramkaran, the police personnel in the front line opened fire killing unarmed people and injuring some of them. Then the second-line policemen came. They took possession of the corpses instead of giving them to their families. Along with this, they also took the injured with them, who were sent to jail without better treatment. This also led to the death of Jairaj Yadav 32 years later.

After this, the third-line police personnel entered the village. They started arresting the innocents present in the houses. At the same time, in the name of search, they looted the jewellery kept hidden by the women. On protesting, the cots of the sick elderly people were broken.

Nobody listened to the villagers

After a pause, Ramkaran Singh said that the villagers had to suffer unilateral action in the Sandpur massacre that took place under the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. Despite the murder of the villagers, no action was taken against the police.

Ramkaran Singh and other villagers together complained with every competent officer and leader right from the local level up to Lucknow to take action against the district administration. However, all these complaints were put in the dustbin. On the contrary, 40 named villagers and many others were identified as accused in the case against the villagers. These included the ones who lost their family members in the police firing, those who were injured in the firing and other villagers.

Not only humans but even the animals of the village were tortured

Suresh Kumar Pandey, a local public representative from Ramnagar, a neighbouring village of Sandpur, told OpIndia that he was well aware of the incident of 22nd October 1990. Then he was an intermediate student. He said that then even small trails were sealed, let alone the main roads.

Suresh claimed that the brutality shown by the police at that time by raiding the Sandpur village would not have been seen in India under the rule of tyrants. According to Suresh, not only humans but also the animals reared in the village starved due to police brutality for several days. There was no one left to feed them.

Careers of youth ruined

Suresh Kumar Pandey also claimed that in the incident of 22nd October 1990, the police had named many young villagers who were not in the village on the day of the incident. Due to being named in the case and subsequently going to jail, the careers of all those youths were also ruined.

According to Suresh, all this brutality took place on the orders of the then Mulayam Singh Yadav regime. Whoever went to the police station to advocate for the villagers named in this case was beaten up and called a Kar Sevak. People were sent to jail in false cases.

SC/ST, OBC, General Category – everyone was tortured

Numerous victims of police brutality secured bail from the Allahabad High Court, while others, who had been evading arrest due to fear of the police, eventually surrendered in court. Ramkaran Singh was identified as the primary accused by the police in this case. The individuals subjected to accusations and torment encompassed individuals from various categories within Hindu society, including SC/ST, OBC, and those in the general category.

As per Ramkaran, Sukhu, Ram Sumer, and Dadhibal Singh, who were subjected to police brutality, were incapacitated, and unable to rise from their beds for six months. The legal proceedings are currently ongoing in the Basti district court. All the accused are contesting the case by liquidating their land and assets or utilising their hard-earned funds.

Out of the 40 named accused, about 20 villagers have died at different times due to different reasons. Speaking to OpIndia, another villager, Harilal Singh, said that he too was named as an accused in the same case.

Harilal asserts that he was completely unrelated to the dispute, yet the police apprehended him from outside his house and incarcerated him. After spending 16 days behind bars, Harilal Singh managed to secure bail. According to him, when the men were imprisoned, their female counterparts were taken to safe homes by relatives. The situation reached a point where, for an extended period, there was no one left in the village to kindle the lamp.

It is good that the police did not find the Kar Sevaks

Ramkaran Singh shared that in 1990, he held the position of a school principal. The police action during that time had a profound and devastating impact on him and his family. Despite dedicated efforts over the past 34 years, Ramkaran’s family continues to grapple with the aftermath. Nevertheless, Ramkaran Singh finds solace in the thought that, for the greater good, the police did not apprehend the karsevaks who had come from different parts of the country. Otherwise, no one can guess what would have happened to them.

Even today, ready to sacrifice in the name of Lord Ram

Regarding the police rampage in his village, Ramkaran added, “Those who died went to heaven. All those who are alive like us are still ready to sacrifice in the name of Ram if needed.”

Ramkaran Singh has no regrets about what he and his family suffered for taking the police’s anger towards the Kar Sevaks on his head. Ramkaran and his family express immense joy over the construction of the grand temple dedicated to Lord Ram at Ramjanmabhoomi. They take pride in the fact that their family has played a role in this noble endeavour, acknowledging the sacrifices made for the cause."

Justice Girish Kathpalia of Delhi High Court dismissed Moitra’s application seeking a stay of the eviction order in view of the pendency of the issue of her expulsion from Lok Sabha before the Supreme Court. The court also refused to grant an extension of the eviction notice letting her stay in the govt house for a few more months.

The court noted that the issue of extension of time to vacate the government accommodation is inextricably linked with the plea pending with the Supreme Court. The Court further noted that as of date she has no right to govt accommodation as she is no longer an MP.

“This court is not inclined to invoke jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India at this stage to restrain the operation of the impugned eviction order. Accordingly, the application stands dismissed,” the court said.

The court order further said, “The petitioner having been allotted the government accommodation incidental to her status as a Member of Parliament and that status having ceased upon her expulsion, which expulsion has not been stayed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court despite hearing afforded to her, presently she has no right to continue in the said government accommodation and accordingly, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, she cannot be granted protection as sought.”

Senior Advocate Brij Gupta, along with Advocates Shadan Farasat and Warisha Farasat, appeared for Moitra. ASG Chetan Sharma appeared for Union Government’s Directorate of Estates.

Earlier on Wednesday, the former MP received fresh notice to vacate her government-allotted accommodation in New Delhi after she failed to vacate the house. This was the third notice served to Moitra by the Directorate of Estate, under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, asking her to vacate her official bungalow and comes shortly after she was expelled from the Lok Sabha in connection with the ‘cash-for-query’ case.

The Noice also warned of “use of force” if necessary, in case she does not vacate by the deadline.

“The Applicant vide Letter dated 08.01.2024 requested to initiate eviction proceedings against, you under the provisions of Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1971,” the notice of Office of the Estate Officer and Assistant Director of Estates (Litigation), Directorate of Estates read.

The Ministry of Urban Development served the second notice to Mahua on January 11 this year.

The TMC leader had approached the Delhi High Court, seeking the quashing of the notice issued by the Directorate of Estate cancelling her government accommodation in the national capital.

The plea stated that a notice had been issued to her on December 11, 2023, which directed her to vacate the house by 7.01.2024, failing which proceedings under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants Act) 1971 (‘PP Act 1971’) will be caused to be initiated.

The plea prayed to allow her to retain possession of her government accommodation till the results of the 2024 General Elections.

It also stated that the absence of government accommodation poses a significant impediment to the petitioner’s ability to host and engage with party members, parliamentarians, fellow politicians, visiting constituents, key stakeholders and other dignitaries, which is essential, especially in the lead up to a general election.

Rejecting these arguments, Justice Kathpalia observed that the allotment of government accommodation to Moitra was “co-terminus” with her status as an MP which has come to an end upon her expulsion from the Lok Sabha. “No specific Rule has been brought before this court which would deal with the eviction of Members of Parliament from the government accommodation after they cease to be the members,” the court said.

The court said that from the arguments of Mahua Moitra it was clear that she wanted to retain the govt bungalow so that she can effectively campaign for upcoming Lok Sabha elections. It further said that is not even a whisper of her unfortunate medical condition, which was being claimed by her counsel.

Moitra was on December 8, 2023, expelled from the Lok Sabha after a discussion on the report of the Ethics Committee in the ‘cash for query’ that was tabled in the Lower House. It was done after she admitted that she had given her parliament portal credentials to businessman Darshan Hiranandani. Using her login ID, Hiranandani had posted multiple questions on the TMC MP’s behalf in Lok Sabha. The questions were related to his businesses and targeted his rival, Gautam Adani.

While Moitra admitted she gave him the login credentials, she claimed it was not illegal. The expelled Lok Sabha MP alleged that she has been found guilty of breaching a code of ethics that ‘does not exist’.

She was forced to confess after Darshan Hiranandani filed an affidavit admitting that he had posted questions using her credentials. He had also disclosed that he gave her several expensive gifts and other favours in exchange of this.

The Ethics Committee report probing ‘Unethical Conduct’ of the TMC MP had recommended that Moitra “may be expelled” from the Lok Sabha and called for an “intense, legal, institutional inquiry” by the central government in a “time-bound manner”.

The report was adopted by a 6:4 majority in the panel last month. The report on Moitra’s cash-for-query case revealed that she visited the UAE four times from 2019 to 2023 while her login was accessed several times."

Now, the Balochistan Liberation Army, which has been active in the region since 2000, has released a statement where it has sworn to avenge the attack launched by Pakistan, reports India Today.

“Pakistan will have to pay a price for it,” the group warned.

“Now the Baloch Liberation Army will not remain silent. We will avenge it and we announce war on the state of Pakistan,” the ethnic group was further quoted as saying by India Today.

Meanwhile, a statement claimed to be issued by the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) is also doing rounds on social media. X user @RealBababanaras posted the BLF statement and said that the rebel group has refuted Pakistan’s claims and said that they do not have any hideouts in Iran.

Aljazeera also quoted the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) as saying that it “has no hideouts in Iran” and none of “our Saramchar [fighters] was martyred in the recent attacks by Pakistan”.

This comes after the Pakistan army today (Thursday, January 18) released operational details of its strikes and said it carried out precision strikes in Iran using killer drones, rockets, loitering munitions and stand-off weapons that struck ‘terrorist’ groups Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front

On January 18, Pakistan launched “precision military strikes” against what it claimed “terrorist hideouts” in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province leaving four children and three women dead in its “intelligence-based operation” named “Marg Bar Sarmachar”. Subsequently, Iran summoned Pakistan’s charge d’affaires to protest against the missile attack.

Pakistan’s ‘precision strike’ came after on 16th January, Iran attacked the headquarters of a terrorist group with drones and missiles inside Pakistan’s territorial borders. Two important headquarters of Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) in Pakistan were destroyed. The strikes were concentrated in an area in Pakistan’s Balochistan region where “one of the largest headquarters” of Jaish al-Adl was located. Following the air strike by Iran, Pakistan expelled the Tehran envoy and recalled its ambassador."

In a note posted on her Instagram on Thursday (18th January), the actress said that she did not intend to hurt anyone’s sentiments.

Nayanthara began her apology with “Jai Shri Ram” and said that the makers of the film attempted to give a “positive message”, however, in the process they may have “inadvertently caused hurt.”

Further, the actress added that the film’s team did not expect a film passed by the censor board and already released in theatres, to be removed from an OTT platform.

“We did not expect the removal of a censored film, previously showcased in theatres, from the OTT platform. My team and I never intended to hurt anyone’s sentiments and we understand the gravity of this issue,” Nayanthara wrote.

Moreover, Nayanthara asserted that she is a firm believer of God and often visits temples across the country adding that causing hurt to religious sensibilities intentionally would be the last thing she would do.

“Being someone who wholely believes in God and frequently visits temples across the country, it is the last thing I would intentionally do. To those whose feelings we’ve touched, I extend my sincere and heartfelt apologies,” she added.

Towards the end of her apology note, the actress said that the film Annapoorani was meant to “uplift and inspire, not to cause distress.”

Notably, Nayanthara’s apology comes just days after Zee Studios issued an apology to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) for hurting Hindu religious sentiments of the Hindu community in their film ‘Annapoorani’. The letter stated that Zee has urged the film’s co-producers, M/s Trident Arts, to take appropriate action against the problematic parts in the film, as well as Netflix to remove the movie from its OTT platform till the film is not altered. Zee apologized for offending the religious sentiments of the Hindu and Brahmin communities.

‘Annapoorani’ was released on Netflix on 28th December last year and is the 75th film of Tamil actress Nayanthara. The movie is produced by Trident Arts, Zee Studios and Naad Studios. However, Netflix de-platformed the movie on January 11.

As reported earlier, the film garnered a lot of criticism on social media recently for its anti-Hindu content. The film was accused of promoting conversion to Islam, misrepresenting the revered Hindu deity Bhagwan Ram and offending the religious sentiments of Hindus.

On 6th January, former Shiv Sena leader Ramesh Solanki filed a police complaint against the makers of the film ‘Annapoorani’. Solanki, the founder of Hindu IT Cell, wrote to the Chief Inspector of the Lokmanya Tilak police station, seeking action against the anti-Hindu nature of the feature film.

According to the Hindu activist, the movie ‘Annapoorani’ featured several objectionable scenes. Those include the offering of Namaz (Islamic prayer) by the daughter of a Hindu Brahmin temple priest, glorification of love jihad, and falsehoods about Lord Ram and Maa Sita devouring meat in Ramayana. On 10th January, another FIR (First Information Report) was registered against the film’s makers and actors in Madhya Pradesh by the Hindu Seva Parishad."

It must be mentioned that the community had vowed to not wear a turban until a majestic Ram Mandir was reconstructed at the site where a disputed structure was built by Mughal tyrant Babur.

The wait of almost 500 years ended for the Suryanshi Thakur community on Thursday (18th January) when they finally wore their turbans at the Sarairasi village of Ayodhya.

#WATCH | Uttar Pradesh: People from the 'Suryavanshi Thakur' community in Sarairasi village of Ayodhya wear turbans after almost 500 years, ahead of Ram Temple's 'pranpratishtha'.

Residing in approximately 115 villages along both banks of the Saryu River in Ayodhya and the neighboring Basti district, the Suryavanshi Thakurs identify themselves as the descendants of the Lord Ram.

Their belief is rooted in the historical account that around 90,000 of their ancestors fought a war against Mir Baqi, the commander of the first Mughal tyrant Babur who demolished an ancient Ram temple and built a disputed structure atop it.

While speaking about the matter, a 63-year-old Suryanvanshi Thakur named Dayaram Singh told The Print, “A total of 76 battles were fought for the liberation of the Ram janmabhoomi from Babur’s era till British rule. When our forefathers heard about Mir Baqi having brought down the temple, they were incensed and decided to liberate the Ram janmabhoomi. They gathered an army of 90,000 Suryavanshi Thakurs and decided to wage a war against the Mughal army.”

He added, “As they marched towards the Ram janmabhoomi, the warriors gathered at Surya Kund where they took a vow that they would not wear a pagdi on their heads, neither wear a panahi [leather shoes] on their feet nor cover their heads with an umbrella till they liberated Lord Ram’s janmabhoomi”

During the Ram Janmabhoomi movement of the 1990s, the Suryavanshi Thakurs played a crucial role in supporting the karsevaks (Lord Ram drboteee) who arrived from various parts of the country. They provided food, shelter, and assistance to these karsevaks and ensure their safe passage to the janmabhoomi site.

Shiv Singh, a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and a resident of Sarairasi village, has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to extend an invitation to at least one representative from the Suryavanshi Thakur community to Ram Mandir consecration ceremonu."

One Shankar Shalaya Wani (age 40) was arrested in this case. The alleged mastermind of this cow trafficking nexus Mahipati Bhosle is absconding. Both were booked under section 11(A) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960.

On 16th January, Gorakshak Suraj Dharam – a member of the Bajrang Dal Ambegaon Section – received information that some young calves would be loaded in sacks and taken for slaughter in a mini tempo from Mahaluge Padwal. He and his fellow activists shared this information with the Manchar police station inspector Balwant Mandge.

As soon as the information was received, police officers were immediately sent to help the Gorakshaks. When the police inspected the vehicle, they found three calves stuffed in sacks and the sacks were tied from outside. The accused Mahipat Bhagwant fled the spot after learning that the police vehicle was approaching. The police arrested his driver Shankar Shalaya Wani. A complaint was filed by police constable Firoz Momin and an FIR was registered in which both the accused were implicated under section 11(A) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. A copy of this complaint is with OpIndia.

Gorakshaks and Bajrang Dal members Amol Barave, Atul Thorat, Shubham Gholap, Piyush Thorat, Suraj Lokhande, Sachin Lokhande, Atul Nighot, Sagar Renukadas, Aniket Rajguru, Akshay Rajguru, Babu Dethe, Sujal Dolas, Pawan Lokhande, Ayush Kadam, Monu Pokharkar worked for this action. They took the rescued calves to a Goshala in Bhosari. An activist at Mahaluge Padwal intercepted the vehicle, but one of the accused fled before the team arrived with the police force.

In an interaction with OpIndia, Gorakshak Suraj Dharam said that Mahipat Bhosle has several cases of cow smuggling registered against him in all four talukas surrounding Manchar. Suraj Dharam said, “Mahipat Bhosale runs a large-scale cow smuggling nexus in Khed, Ambegaon, Junnar and Shirur talukas. The man buys or steals native cows, bulls, jerseys, buffaloes and small calves from various places and delivers these destitute animals to slaughterhouses. He carries some women with him while transporting the smuggled cattle. When someone stops the vehicle, these women protest and fight with Gorakshaks. On several occasions, they have carried out deadly attacks on our fellow Gorakshaks.”

Suraj Dharam further said, “Using these women as a shield, false cases have been filed on several occasions against Gorakshaks who came to save the cows. In some cases, hundreds of cow killers and traffickers gather at the spot as well as at the police station and put pressure on the administration. Since Mahipat Bhosle has been in this business for many years, he made a lot of money. His agents work everywhere in the four talukas and come to his aid from time to time. He has set up unauthorised sheds at the foot of the hill behind Annasaheb Awte College at Shindewadi. Cows and calves are brought and tied to this place and taking advantage of the darkness of the night, the animals are taken for slaughter to Junnar, Ale Phata, Belhe and other places.”

Suraj Dharam added, “If someone asks, they are told that the animals are looked after at this place. These issues are dealt with by lying in a very brazen manner. Hundreds of people travel there every day on the road but no one takes pity on these cows and calves. No one objects. People don’t even give simple sneaky information. There is a demand from the people to take strict action against Mahipat Bhosle for a long time.”"

The ‘Pran Pratishtha’ of Shri Ram Lalla at the historic temple will take place on January 22.

The fourth-day rituals began at the temple today at 9 a.m. with the lighting of holy fire.

The idol of Shri Ram Lalla, which was placed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in Ayodhya on Thursday, will be given ‘Aushdhadhiwas’ (medicinal abode), ‘Kesaradhiwas’ (saffron abode), ‘Dhritashiwas’ (Dhrita abode), and ‘Pushpadhiwas’ (flower abode).

Following this, the idol will be kept in saffron and later in grains.

The temple doors will be closed to visitors until January 22 and will be reopened the next day.

Meanwhile, as ‘Pran Pratishtha’ Day approaches, the security in Ayodhya’s Karsevakpuram has been beefed up, the area where Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust General Secretary Champat Rai resides.

Visuals showed posters of Ram Lalla installed in several places in the city as it gears up to hold the grand ceremony. Selfie points have been established in several places near the Lata Mangeshkar Chowk, situated near the Naya Ghat at the intersection of Ram Path and Dharm Path.

Posters and banners featuring Ram Lalla were seen illuminating the ‘Ram Nagri’.

As the celebrations of ‘Amrit Mahotsava’ continue, the ‘Vishwa Hindu Parishad’ has set up tea stalls to provide free tea and biscuits to the visitors coming to Ayodhya.

Ayodhya is observing ‘Amrit Mahotsava’ ahead of the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony.

The idol of Lord Ram was placed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in Ayodhya on Thursday. Covered with a veil, the first photo of the idol was revealed during the placement ceremony in the sanctum sanctorum on Thursday.

The photos were shared by Sharad Sharma, media in-charge of Vishwa Hindu Parishad.Vedic Brahmins and revered Acharyas were seen leading worship ceremonies inside the sacred precincts of the Sri Ram Temple.

According to the VHP, members of the Ram Janmabhoomi Tirth Kshetra also participated in the prayers.

The idol of ‘Ram Lalla’ was carved by Arun Yogiraj, a famed sculptor from Karnataka. The idol is 51 inches tall and weighs 1.5 tonnes. The idol portrays Lord Ram as a five-year-old child standing on a lotus also crafted from the same stone.

The Pran Pratishta ceremony will be held in Ayodhya on January 22. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will perform rituals to mark the ‘Pran Pratishtha’; however, a team of priests led by Lakshmikant Dixit will perform the main rituals.

Several celebrities and noted personalities have also been invited to the ceremony.

In a letter addressed to Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, he objected to the Pran Pratishtha of a new idol of Shri Ram in place of the existing idol of Shri Ram Lalla which was discovered at the Ram Janmabhoomi in 1949.

Notably, a clarification has already been issued by the trust in this regard nearly a year ago. This row comes at a time when the controversy over the Shankaracharya’s refusal to attend the Pran Pratishtha has barely settled.

The letter written by the Shankaracharya states, “The question that arises is that if the new idol will be consecrated then will happen to Shri Ram Lalla Virajman? Till now the devotees were of the impression that the new temple is being made for Shri Ram Lalla Virajman but now the installation of some new idol in the sanctum sanctorum for consecration has raised doubts about whether this will be disrespectful to Shri Ram Lalla Virajman.”

He has appealed to the trust only Shri Ram Lalla Virajman’s idol should be consecrated “otherwise it will be considered injustice to Shri Ram Lalla Virajman”.

Moreover, the letter also addresses Ram Mandir’s Chief Architect Chandrakant Sompura asking why he allowed for the temple to be available for Pran Pratishtha when it is not yet complete.

The trust had issued a clarification about a year ago

In April 2023, when the initial information about Shri Ram’s new idol was released, a question that struck the mind of many Hindus was that when one Ram Lalla idol is already present, why do we need the second idol?

OpIndia spoke to Vishwa Hindu Parishad (South Bihar) district head Kameshwar Choupal, also a member of the trust, to understand the rationale behind the decision.

Choupal said that there are two types of idols; one is known as ‘Utsav Murti’ and the other is known as ‘Pran Pratishtha Murti’. “Pran Pratishtha idols cannot be moved anywhere, they stay where they are installed. At the same time, ‘Utsav Murti’ is taken out in events like Jhankis or Shobha Yatras,” he said.

He said that the new idol of Shri Ram placed on a pedestal in the Garbha Griha would give devotees a clear sight of the idol right from head to toe from a distance of 19 feet.

It must be noted that the existing idol of Shri Ram Lalla Virajman will be placed in the temple during the Pran Pratishtha.

Since Shri Ram Lalla Virajman’s idol is smaller in size, it is evident that it will be enshrined as the ‘Utsav Murti’ and will be taken out for Jhankis and Shobha Yatras while the new idol will be placed as the ‘Pran Pratishtha Murti’.

Notably, the existing idol of Shri Ram Lalla Virajman is merely six inches in height and the idols of his brothers and his Supreme devotee Hanuman are even smaller. This was also one of the reasons why the trust decided to make a bigger standing idol.

So where will Shri Ram Lalla Virajman be?

As per reports, the new idol of Shri Ram has been installed in the sanctum sanctorum while the existing idol of Shri Ram Lalla Virajman along with his brothers Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughna will installed right in front of the new idol inside the sanctum sanctorum.

Yet another controversy coming from a Dharmaguru ahead of the most pious ceremonies and celebrations in the country is in bad taste.

और दूसरी बात अयोध्या में जो भी कुछ हो रहा है शास्त्र सम्मत हो रहा है प्रभु राम जी की कृपा से हो रहा है



तीसरी बात फिर से आप शंकराचार्य नहीं है न्यायालय ने रोक लगा रखी है — SAFFRON 🚩 (@Adv_saffron) January 18, 2024

Netizens have been openly expressing their displeasure with the Shankaracharya who first refused to attend the Pran Pratishtha citing that the Ram Mandir structure was incomplete and hence Pran Pratishtha was against rituals.

However, many experts, the most primary being the renowned Hindu astrologer Shri Ganeshwar Shastri Dravid Ji, have cited several Hindu scriptures providing evidence as to why the Pran Pratishtha can indeed be performed even if the temple structure is not entirely constructed.

Moreover, Jyotirmath Shankaracharya has also gone on to make borderline political statements implying that the government is in a rush to conduct the consecration owing to political reasons."

“House number 9B Telegraph Lane occupied by Mahua Moitra, was fully vacated by 10 am this morning (January 19, 2024) and the possession was handed over by her lawyers to the Directorate of Estates, who are inspecting and engaged in due process. Premises were vacated before authorities arrived and no eviction took place at all,” Moitra’s office said in a statement to ANI.

Earlier, on Thursday, the Delhi High Court refused to grant relief to the TMC leader and denied her stay on the operation of eviction of the government bungalow.

Moitra challenged the eviction order and sought a stay.

The high court noted that her eviction was not stayed by the Supreme Court. Justice Girish Kathpaliya dismissed the interim application seeking a stay of operation of the eviction order of January 16, 2024.

Dismissing her application the high court stated, “In view of the pendency of the issue of expulsion of petitioner before the Supreme Court and the issue of extension of time to vacate the government accommodation being inextricably linked with that, coupled with the fact that as on date petitioner has no right.”

“This court is not inclined to invoke jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to restrain the operation of the impugned eviction order. Accordingly, the application stands dismissed,” the HC stated in its order.

“The petitioner having been allotted the government accommodation incidental to her status as a Member of Parliament and that status having ceased upon her expulsion, which expulsion has not been stayed by the Supreme Court despite hearing afforded to her, presently she has no right to continue in the said government accommodation and accordingly, under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, she cannot be granted protection as sought,” Justice Kathpaliya said in the order pronounced on Thursday.

The court stated further that the allotment of government accommodation to the ‘petitioner’ was a co-terminus with her status, which has come to an end upon her expulsion as a member of the Lower House of Parliament.

The court pointed out that no specific rule had been brought before the court pertaining to the eviction of MPs from the government accommodation after they cease to be members.

The petitioner sought retention of her government accommodation on the ground that her expulsion as a Member of Parliament was “contrary to law and the procedure laid down by Section 3B of the Act was not followed and despite the respondent no. 1 (Estate officer) having deferred the decision till resolution of representation of the petitioner by authorities the eviction order was passed”.

It was also submitted that in view of her medical condition and the difficulties she would face during campaigning for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, she deserves an extension of time to vacate the government bungalow allotted to her. (ANI)

He also gave detailed information about the progress and plans of the country’s nuclear power sector.

In an interview with ‘The Hindu’, BC Pathak said, “India already has a plan to increase its present installed nuclear power capacity of 7,480 MW to 22,480 MW by 2031-2032 in a progressive manner. We made India’s largest indigenously developed 700-MWe pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) – the fourth unit in Kakrapar, Gujarat. We made the reactor critical in July 2020 and connected it to the grid in January 2021, in six months. There were some commissioning experiments to be done after that. We had to take care of the commissioning challenges and we have addressed those issues now. Accordingly, it was declared commercial on 30th June 2023 and started generating its commercial power of 700 MWe on 30th August 2023.”

He further said, “The electricity requirement in our country is huge. Our indigenously built largest reactor is 700-MWe. For major capacity addition, we will go ahead with the 700-MWe PHWRs. However, if required, we may go for 220-MWe PHWRs, which are equally proven. Until now, we were building two or four reactors at a time. But now, nine reactors are under construction at present. Ten reactors are in various pre-project activities. So 19 reactors are under various stages of implementation.”

BC Pathak said, “Globally, on average, the energy composition consists of about 20% electricity and 80% energy from coal, petrol, diesel, gas, lignite, and other components. Efforts are being made to decarbonise the electricity sector by putting up solar power plants, wind energy, renewables, and nuclear power plants. The 80% energy sector consists of fuel that is being directly used as molecules or as a reducing agent. There is a need to decarbonise that sector also.”

The NPCIL chief added, “Efforts are being made globally to replace this fuel with a fuel that does not emit carbon dioxide. That is why the emphasis is being made on the production of green hydrogen. Green hydrogen, to some extent, will help in decarbonisation. In future, nuclear power may play a major role in producing hydrogen because nuclear is clean energy. Hydrogen, produced from clean energy sources, is generally termed green hydrogen. That is why nuclear has a dual role – in terms of electricity generation and as a promising potential clean energy source.”

BC Pathak additionally highlighted India’s dedication to expanding its nuclear power capacity and provided updates on the advancements of several nuclear projects nationwide. These include upcoming reactors like Rajasthan Atomic Power Station-7 (RAPS-7), Madras Atomic Power Station-1 (MAPS-1), Tarapur Atomic Power Station-1 (TAPS-1), as well as ongoing initiatives such as the development of Kudankulam-3,4, 5, and 6 reactors. Furthermore, he addressed the country’s efforts in promoting green hydrogen production.

BC Pathak elucidated the commitment of NPCIL to a three-stage nuclear power program, underscoring the sequential evolution of nuclear technology. He conveyed optimism regarding India’s ability to achieve energy self-sufficiency as it advances through the stages of its nuclear power program."

Notably, she was employed by Anto Mathivanan and Marlina, the son and daughter-in-law of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader and MLA I Karunanithi.

The victim in a video released by the nonprofit organisation Evidence revealed that she finished her 12th grade and was hired as a domestic helper using an agency. She was employed in Anto Mathivanan and his wife Marlina’s home in Chennai. She further mentioned that her salary had not been reimbursed.

She complained, “Even if I don’t do the smallest task properly, they would slap me on my face. Once, they asked me to prepare food by 6 am because they were going out of town. I hadn’t slept till 2 am the previous night. Nobody can survive without sleeping. I could only get up by 7 am. Because I couldn’t keep the food ready, they burnt my hands using a hair straightener,” while narrating her ordeal.

She pointed out, “I was 17 years old when I was taken to do domestic work and beaten with things like slippers, spoons, broom and mops, leaving bloody wounds all over my body,” in her report. She expressed that out of the two, the daughter-in-law harassed her more by abusing her and chopping off her hair. Her family is not well off, so she worked to earn money as she studied for the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET) to study medicine. She finished Class 12 last year with 433 marks out of 600. Her mother was employed in another Chennai home as a domestic staff. She unveiled that even though she was promised a Rs 16,000 monthly income, she only received Rs 5000.

She highlighted that they refused to take her to the hospital regardless of how much they “tortured” her or how much she bled and added, “I had to treat it myself.” Furthermore, she divulged that the couple had threatened her. They told her they were from an “MLA’s family” and no one would rescue her even if she notified anybody about her situation.

The girl had returned to her family members in Ulundurpet, Kallakurichi for the Pongal festival holidays when the torment came to light. Her family saw that she had marks from injuries on her body and brought her to a government hospital in Ulundurpet. According to the police, she went to a government hospital and received treatment for abrasions as an outpatient. The hospital alerted the Ulundurpet police who then informed the Adyar police in Chennai and registered it in their accident registration. Police, however, stated that neither the woman nor her family had made any complaints to them.

An official informed, “We got information from the government hospital and based on that, we reached out to them. But a formal complaint is yet to be filed either in Chennai or Ulundurpet.” An Adyar police officer who wished to remain anonymous stated, “We sent a lady police officer to record a statement from her (the victim).”

The statement was captured from 10 pm on 17th January beyond midnight. However, the victim has subsequently written another complaint to Director General of Police (DGP) Shankar Jiwal, as no First Information Report (FIR) has been filed at this point.

Vincent Raj, an anti-caste activist based in Madurai stated that the police have advised them that a formal complaint will be submitted soon. “When she was a minor she was tortured for more than eight months. She turned 18 only last month. The strictest action must be taken,” he demanded.

Bharatiya Janata Party’s Tamil Nadu president K Annamalai also took to social media and posted, “The news that an 18-year-old social girl, who worked at the house of Chennai Pallavaram assembly member Karunanidhi’s son, was severely beaten and burned with cigarettes by the son and daughter-in-law of assembly member Karunanidhi is very shocking.”

He added, “It shows the arrogance of the DMK to attack a young woman who came to work as a domestic worker because medical education will help her study and because of a simple family situation. It is also revealed that after claiming Rs.16,000 per month, they have paid only Rs.5,000 for all these months. I urge on behalf of BJP Tamil Nadu that an immediate, speedy investigation be conducted and action be taken against the culprits under the Prevention of Atrocities Act.”

Karunanithi, however, refuted the woman’s allegations and claimed that his son’s family had treated the young woman nicely and had only “pulled her up after she did something wrong.” He alleged that they were helping her in their studies in addition to giving her jewellery. “I usually don’t go there (to his son’s house). The girl had done something wrong, and they pulled her up for that. They are helping her to study. She is taking online classes. They have also got her jewellery and other things.”"

The new guidelines call for a financial penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh or the termination of coaching institutes’ registration if they charge exorbitant prices or engage in other malpractices.

According to officials, the standards for regulating coaching institutes were developed to address the need for a legal framework and to govern the unregulated proliferation of private coaching centres.

The Ministry’s most recent recommendations were issued in response to government complaints about an increase in student suicides, fire events, a lack of facilities in coaching circumstances, and the instructional methodology used by them.

“No coaching center shall engage tutors having qualifications less than graduation. The institutions cannot make misleading promises or guarantee rank or good marks to parents for enrolling students in the coaching centers. The institutes cannot enroll students below 16 years of age. Student enrolment should be only after secondary school examination,” the guidelines said.

“The coaching institutes cannot publish or cause to be published or take part in the publication of any misleading advertisement relating to any claim, directly or indirectly, of quality of coaching or the facilities offered therein or the result procured by such coaching center or the student who attended such class,” it added.

According to the new criteria, coaching centers may not recruit any tutor or individual who has been convicted of a moral turpitude-related violation. The new standards state that an institute will not be registered unless it has a counseling system that meets the requirements of these guidelines.

“Coaching centers shall have a website with updated details of the qualification of tutors, courses/curriculum, duration of completion, hostel facilities, and the fees being charged,” the guidelines stated.

The new guidelines also instructed coaching centers to take steps to improve student’s mental health, citing intense competitiveness and academic pressure.

“They should put in place an urgent intervention strategy to provide targeted and ongoing assistance to kids who are in distress or stressed,” the guidelines said. According to the instructions, the competent authorities may take actions to guarantee that the coaching center develops and makes a counseling system easily accessible to students and parents.

“All students and parents may be given information about the identities of psychologists and counselors, as well as the times when they provide services. Trained counselors should be assigned to the coaching center to provide appropriate guidance and counseling to students and parents,” the guidelines noted.

Additionally, it stated that teachers “may undergo training in mental health issues to convey information effectively and sensitively to students about their areas of improvement”.

The rules outlining the framework for mental well-being come after a growing number of student suicides in Kota in 2023. The new standards require tuition costs for various courses and curricula to be fair and reasonable, and receipts for the fees charged must be made public.

“If the student has paid for the course in full and is leaving the course in the middle of the prescribed period, a student will be refunded from out of the fees deposited earlier for the remaining period on a pro-rata basis within 10 days,” the guidelines added.

“If the student was staying in the hostel of the coaching centre then the hostel fees and mess fee etc. will also be refunded. Under no circumstances, the fee based on which enrolment has been made for a particular course and duration shall be increased during the currency of the course,” it said.

The idol is crafted from ‘shyamal’ (dark) stone which shows the Lord Ram as a five-year-old boy standing on a lotus composed of the same stone. An image of the idol was also shared by Union Minister Shobha Karandlaje who wrote, “The dream of decades has now become a reality.” However, it seems that the image was taken at the workshop, and not at the sanctum-sanctorum, as it is inside a shed.

After the installation of the idol on the marble platform yesterday, workers gave the finishing touches to the platform today.

The 150 kg and 51-inch idol, sculpted by popular Mysuru artist Arun Yogiraj who has a family background of five generations of renowned sculptors was brought to the temple on the night of 17th January accompanied by the chanting of prayers and placed on the marble pedestal in the Garbhagriha in the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra in his presence.

The idol travelled to the Ram Mandir by a procession that stopped briefly at the temple of Hanumangarhi. According to accounts, four hours of religious rites and mantra chanting were performed while the deity was positioned on the marble podium. .

The idol’s left hand has the pose of holding a bow, which has not been placed yet. However, an image of the idol taken outside the temple shows Ram Lalla holding a bow and arrow. This image also does not have the blindfold.

It is a stone statue and will transform into an idol after the Pran Pratishtha (consecration ceremony). The sculpture is going to remain covered until then. The blindfold that covers the idol’s eyes is scheduled to be taken off on the day of the Pran Pratishtha. The door of the sanctum sanctorum has also been covered with a curtain. Only a select number of priests would perform rituals till the consecration ceremony.

The Pram Pratishtha of the idol installed on the mandapa will be during the auspicious ‘Abhijeet Muhurta’ from 12.20 pm to 1 pm. Ganeshwar Shastri Dravid, a priest and Vedic scholar from Kashi will lead and manage a group of 121 acharyas who are in charge of executing the ceremonies preceding the major event. Laxmikant M Dixit from Kashi has been named as the principal acharya who is descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674."

Moreover, more than 50 jurists including former Chief Justices of India (CJIs) and lawyers have also been invited.

On 9th November 2019, the five-judge bench of the apex court put an end to the dispute that spanned centuries by handover the Ram Janmabhoomi land to Hindu parties paving the way for the Ram Mandir to be built at the birthplace of Shri Ram.

The 5-judge bench of the Supreme Court delivered a unanimous judgement in the Ram Janmabhoomi case. The top 5 senior judges decided after weighing the arguments presented by all sides for 40 days. The bench comprised the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi, former CJI SA Bobde, Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and former Supreme Court judges Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer.

Delivering the much-anticipated verdict, the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi said that this court must accept the faith and belief of worshippers. Further, the Supreme Court had said that Ram Janmabhoomi is not a juristic person but Shri Ram Lalla Varjaman is.

The Apex court had also ordered the union government to provide 5 acres of land at an alternate site at a prominent location in Ayodhya to the Sunni Waqf Board to rebuild the Babri Masjid which was demolished in 1992.

Invitations have been extended to political leaders, celebrities, sportspersons and other VIP personalities for the event on 22nd January.

The rituals leading up to the ceremony have begun and will culminate with Pran Pratishtha. The idol of Shri Ram has been installed in the sanctum sanctorum."

Rejecting the calls by the United States for a two-state solution after the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli Prime Minister said, “In any future arrangement … Israel needs security control all territory west of Jordan. This clashes with the idea of (Palestinian) sovereignty. What can you do? This conflict is not about the absence of a (Palestinian) state but about the existence of a state, the Jewish state.”

PM Netanyahu’s strong remarks came in response to questions over reports that he has told American officials that he is opposed to the idea of Palestinian sovereignty.

The Israeli Prime Minister further asserted that the country under his leadership will not stop until an absolute victory is secured in its war against Hamas terrorists. “Israel under my leadership will not compromise on less than total victory over Hamas, and we will win. I say this again: We are striving for total victory, not just ‘to strike Hamas’ or ‘to hurt Hamas’, not ‘another round with Hamas’ but total victory over Hamas,” PM Netanyahu said.

Moreover, he reiterated that the release of the hostages taken by Hamas is a primary goal of Israel which he opined could be achieved only through military pressure. He added that Israel aims at the complete destruction of Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.

“We will continue to fight with full force until we achieve all of our goals: Returning our hostages, and I say – only continued military pressure will lead to their release. Eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel, that there will be no element in it that educates for terrorism, finances terrorism and sends terrorists against us….Total victory requires eliminating the terrorist leaders and destroying Hamas’s military and governing capabilities. Total victory requires returning our hostages home. Total victory requires that Gaza be demilitarized, under Israel’s full security control, with Israeli control over everything that enters Gaza. These are also the fundamental conditions for ‘the day after’…We will not finish the war before returning our loved ones home; we will not finish the war before total victory. Together we will fight, and with G-d’s help – together we will win,” PM Netanyahu said.

Meanwhile, the United States responded by stating that there is “no way” of resolving Israel’s long-term security concerns in the region, as well as the short-term challenges of rebuilding the Gaza Strip, without establishing a Palestinian state.

“We will continue to reiterate to the leadership of Israel, the Government of Israel, and to the people of Israel that these are the opportunities that they have, these are the challenges that they face, but there is no way to solve their long-term challenges to provide lasting security, and there is no way to solve the short-term challenges of rebuilding Gaza and establishing governance in Gaza, and providing security for Gaza, without the establishment of a Palestinian state,” US State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller said.

Interestingly, last week, Netanyahu rejected a proposal from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that would have led Saudi Arabia to normalise relations with Israel in exchange for Jerusalem consenting to offer the Palestinians a road to statehood. However, Netanyahu maintained that his position would not preclude Israel from broadening the circle of peace to new Arab countries.

“This truth I tell to our American friends, and I put the brakes on the attempt to coerce us to a reality that would endanger the state of Israel,” Netanyahu said.

On Thursday, White House spokesperson John Kirby was asked about Netanyahu rejecting a Palestinian state in a post-war scenario for Gaza. To this Kirby said that the Biden administration sees it ‘differently’ adding that the US President would continue to push for a two-state solution in a post-war scenario.

“I would just tell you that nothing has changed about President Biden’s desire that a two-state solution is really in the best interest of not only the Israeli people but — but, of course, the Palestinian people. In fact, it’s in the best interest of the region. And we’re not going to stop working towards that goal. This is — this is not a new comment by Prime Minister Netanyahu. We see it differently. We believe that the Palestinians have every right to live in an independent state with peace and security. And the President and his team is going to continue to work on that,” Kirby said."

Added to this, her innumerable anti-Hindu remarks, wrath against Hindus raising the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans combined with the plight of the Hindu community during the 2021 West Bengal post-poll violence and the Chief Minister’s brazen whitewashing of the crime perpetuated by her goons, are sufficient grounds to believe that she has been openly pursuing pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu policies since she took over the reins of the state in her hands.

So much so that, recently, the West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee announced that she would lead an ‘interfaith’ rally across Kolkata on 22 January, the same day the Ram Mandir will be inaugurated in Ayodhya.

Before this, Mamata dubbed the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha event a ‘gimmick’ of the BJP before the Lok Sabha polls, a blatant insult to the 500-year-long battle in which hundreds of Hindus had lost their lives to regain one of the holiest shrines of Hindus.

Nevertheless, Mamata Banerjee’s blatant anti-Hindu mentality cannot obliterate West Bengal’s rich Hindu tradition and cultural heritage. Despite being a multicultural region, the Hindu culture is the one that predominates in West Bengal.

Since the Ram Janmabhoomi campaign gained traction in the late 1980s, historians, politicians, and other members of the Left and the ‘pseudo-liberal’ cabal in Bengal have tried to spread a falsehood that Bhagwan Ram is alien to Bengal and that Bengalis have never worshipped the deity. This narrative was also promoted by Mamata Banerjee’s TMC and folks like Amartya Sen in an attempt to dissuade the general public from supporting the BJP.

Their misinformation campaign claimed that Bengalis had traditionally belonged to the Shakti cult and have been followers of goddess Shakti thus Bhagwan Ram had no place in the Bengali Hindu pantheon of deities worshipped and revered here.

Nonetheless, the centuries-old Ram Mandir in Ramrajatala, a neighbourhood in the Howrah district of West Bengal, stands tall as evidence of Bengali Hindus’ longstanding devotion to Bhagwan Ram. The presence of this Ram Mandir here for over three hundred years proves beyond doubt how harmoniously and syncretically the puja of Shree Ram and Maa Durga has persisted in Bengal throughout the ages.

As the nation gears up for the monumental Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha event in Ayodhya here is some information on the temple of Lord Ram located in the heart of West Bengal for over three centuries and how the region and culture of that state are inextricably linked to the deity.

On January 18, X user @YearOfTheKraken shared a video by The Nation Vibes, which explained how the tradition of worship of Lord Rama has continued in West Bengal for centuries.

Some Aantels have this habit of spreading propaganda that Shri Ram has nothing to do with West Bengal.



Watch this video to discover the long association that West Bengal has with Shri Ram. This video focuses particularly on Ramarajatala in Howrah. pic.twitter.com/7i3CAT5dZY — Sensei Kraken Zero (@YearOfTheKraken) January 18, 2024

The video starts by explaining how the connection of Bhagwan Ram with West Bengal is not new but dates back to the 15th century. It explains how the famous chant ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ has its roots in Bengal as it was written by none other than Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the 15th-century Indian Hindu saint from West Bengal.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is said to be the manifestation of Lord Rama. It is believed that though he is considered to be the combined avatar of Radha and Krishna by his disciples and various scriptures, all other incarnations of God, including Lord Rama, are contained within Lord Chaitanya.

The video, published by The Nation Vibes and shared by @YearOfTheKraken, further talks about the famous Ram Mandir in West Bengal’s Ramrajatala area.

The Ramrajatala Ram Mandir is located in the city of Howrah, West Bengal, India. The temple is dedicated to Lord Ram. The idols of Bhagwan Ram and Sita are erected in the middle of the sanctum santorum in the temple with the idols of Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva standing on either side. Legend has it that Shri Ram spends four months here, from Chaitra to Shravan, and a vibrant mela (fair) is held there each year during this time. The mela, also called “Ram Puja,” is the longest-running fair in West Bengal. It begins on Ram Navami in the Chaitra-Vaishakh months and lasts till the final Sunday of the Shravan month.

This tradition of worshipping Lord Ram for four long months has been followed for the last 300 years.

The video shows a devotee narrating the history of this three centuries-old Ram Mandir. He says that it is believed that Ayodhyaram Choudhury, the zamindar of the area had a divine vision to worship Lord Ram. After toiling for days, he finally took up the task of building a Ram Mandir where devotees worship their deity with great reverence and devotion both morning and evening until today.

In fact, the name of the area where the Mandir is situated- Ramrajatala, also came from the presence of a Mandir dedicated to Lord Rama and the months-long worship undertaken by thousands of people every year at the temple. This tradition of worship of Lord Rama here has continued for almost three centuries.

The video further shows several Bengali devotees explaining the intricate link of Lord Ram with Bengal. One such devout Ram Bhakt is heard saying, “The worship of Lord Ram is just not limited to the Bengali community, in fact, the whole nation; the entire world reveres Bhagwan Ram. Ram is a mantra. Lord Ram represents the Indian culture and Sanatan Dharma.”

Notably, the centuries-old Ram Mandir in West Bengal’s Howrah’s Ramrajatala is just one of the testaments to the connection of the state with Lord Ram. In fact, in an interview given to Swarajya in 2020, Delhi University history professor Saradindu Mukherjee, said there are innumerable accounts in ancient and medieval Bengal of Bhagwan Ram being worshipped. “The Krittibas Ramayan written by the 15th century Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha is the best example of Ramayan’s intricate link with Bengal. Krittibas wrote the Ramayan about 200 years before Tulsidas,” said Mukherjee.

Notably, as one of eight distinguished historians and archaeologists who gathered and compiled evidence of a Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi, Saradindu Mukherjee has been a leading voice in Bengal in dispelling the myth that Lord Ram is alien to Bengal.

Bhagwan Ram has been the subject of numerous literary works in Bengali literature from antiquity to the present, according to Mukherjee. Meghnad Badh (the killing of Ravan’s son Meghnad) by Michael Madhusudan Dutta was regarded as one of Bengal’s best literary works during the British colonial era, he added.

“Nobel laureate Rabindranath Thakur, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, late 19th-century historian and ICS officer Ramesh Chandra Dutta and many others wrote poems and prose eulogising Shree Ram and about the Ramayan. Michael Madhusudan Dutta had said that studying the Ramayan is essential for anyone trying to understand Bharatvarsh,” said Mukherjee.

He continued by saying that Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Thakur had both said that the Ramayan is not a myth but a great epic that records actual events that occurred in ancient India.

“There are many popular proverbs and dictums around Bhagwan Ram and the Ramayan. All these prove that Bengali Hindus revered and worshipped Shree Ram just like Hindus in other parts of the country,” Mukherjee further told Swarajya.

Meanwhile, photographs of the idol of Lord Ram installed in the Garbhagriha of Ram Mandir surfaced on 19th January which exhibit its delicate and complex structures. The Ram Lalla idol was installed on the marble mandapa in the sanctum sanctorum on 18th January, ahead of the consecration ceremony on 22nd January. The first photo of the deity which was covered with a white veil was revealed during the placement ceremony on 18th January.

The idol is crafted from ‘Shyamal’ (dark) stone which shows Lord Ram as a five-year-old boy standing on a lotus composed of the same stone. The 150 kg and 51-inch idol, was sculpted by popular Mysuru artist Arun Yogiraj. An image of the idol was also shared by Union Minister Shobha Karandlaje who wrote, “The dream of decades has now become a reality.” However, it seems that the image was taken at the workshop, and not at the sanctum-sanctorum, as it is inside a shed.

The CBI had earlier said that the investigation is continuing.

Former Delhi deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was produced through video conferencing from Tihar jail.

Special CBI judge MK Nagpal closed the opportunity for accused persons to inspect documents at the office of CBI stating that sufficient time had been given.

The court also said that the matter should be listed for arguments to frame charges.

At this point, counsels for the accused persons said that CBI has not yet concluded the investigation. Thereafter, the court called for the status report so that the arguments on the charges could be commenced. The counsel also said that the status of investigation by the CBI was not cleared. Thereafter the court called for the status report.

The court has extended the judicial custody of Manish Sisodia and other accused persons till February 5, 2024.

Meanwhile, a fresh compliance report has been filed by the Investigating Officer stating search list is supplied.

As per the compliance report a set of DVDs containing charge sheets and relied upon documents to counsel for accused, the court noted.

The Court refused to direct the CBI to supply documents seized during a search at the residence and office of Manish Sisodia to him.

The court noted that the list of searches and documents at the residence and office is prepared and supplied.

Counsel for Sisodia submitted that they had received the search list but not the document seized during the search. He also submitted that the court should see whether the search was legal or illegal.

The court refused and said that there was no provision to supply the documents seized during the search. The issue of legality will be considered during the trial.

However, the court pulled the jail authorities for not informing that Manish Sisodia would be produced through video conferencing.

On December 22, 2023, the court directed the CBI to depute sufficient staff to facilitate the inspection of documents at its headquarters.

The special judge had granted time to counsel of the accused till January 15 to inspect the documents at CBI Headquarters between 10 am to 7 pm.

The court had also directed the CBI to file a compliance report after the inspection of documents.

The court also directed the IO to provide Hindi or English translations of documents if any of them is in the local language of other states.

Counsel for one of the accused had submitted that there were some documents in other languages than Hindi or English.

Former Deputy CM Manish Sisodia is an accused in CBI as well as money laundering case.

In both cases, charge sheets have been filed against Sisodia and other accused persons.

Earlier the Supreme Court of India had dismissed the bail partition of Sisodia. His earlier bail applications were rejected by the High Court as well as the trial court.

Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on February 26. ED arrested him on March 9.

“In the special TADA court, a hearing took place on January 18 regarding the killing of the IAF personnel. The CBI had summoned two witnesses. The witnesses narrated how the incident took place. The witnesses identified Yasin Malik and told the court that he was the one to have opened fire (at the IAF personnel),” Kohli told ANI.

“The witness also informed the court that Malik was also injured in the firing and received four bullet injuries,” she added.

She added that the next date of hearing in the matter has been scheduled for February 15 and 16.

On January 25, 1990, four IAF employees, including Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna, were killed by JKLF terrorists.

Malik, who is serving life imprisonment in Tihar Jail in a terror funding case, was charge-sheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation before the TADA court in Jammu on August 31, 1990, in connection with the case.

Yasin Malik was sentenced to life imprisonment twice.

Nirmal Khanna, the wife of Squadron Leader Khanna, has been fighting for justice for her late husband.

In March 2020, a TADA court observed that there are “sufficient grounds for drawing presumption that the accused Yasin Malik” and others “prima facie have committed” the offence of killing Indian Air Force (IAF) officer Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna and three others.

When they reached the Sarangpur area of the Rajgarh district in Madhya Pradesh, an elderly man inquired about their destination. They replied that they were heading to the Ram Mandir. Hearing this, the man Asghar Khan threatened them that they would be bombed and wouldn’t be able to reach Ayodhya.

The victims were on their way to attend the Pran Pratishta (consecration ceremony) of Lord Ram in Ayodhya which is scheduled to take place on 22nd January when they experienced the shocking assault in Sarangpur on Wednesday afternoon. Neil Patel said that Asghar Khan kept asking them about where they were going and everytime they answered Ayodhya. Khan got angry with this and said, “Go, but I am telling that you will not be able to reach there. Will blow up Ram devotees with bomb,” when they informed him about Ayodhya.

Asghar Khan’s son also joined him and they started hurling abuses at the duo and Dev Patel recorded the incident on his camera. Khan and his son also abused Lord Ram and his devotees.

The two youths reported the episode to the activists of the Hindu Jagaran Manch who were waiting a short distance away to greet them. They said that the father-son duo abused them and threatened to kill them for going to Ayodhya to visit the Ram Mandir. After hearing the entire incident, Mukesh Dubey, the district co-convenor of the Hindu Jagran Manch, took them to the Pachore Police Station, where a complaint was filed.

Pachore Police then took them to the Sarangpur Police Station, where a First Information Report was registered by the police based on the complaint. Sarangpur Police in charge Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the FIR was registered at 9 PM on Wednesday. Asghar Khan and his son were then arrested by Sarangpur police on Thursday."

Any decision by the Modi government triggers a nervous breakdown among this lot of left-leaning ‘liberals’ who had grown accustomed to crumbs thrown at them by the previous regimes that, unfortunately for them, stopped after May 2014.

And since then, these usual suspects, many of whom claim to be ‘journalists’ but are nothing but shameless propagandists, have been ranting against the Modi government, hoping against hope that their routine but asinine outbursts against PM Modi would find some takers and help them take down the might of the Modi juggernaut that, at the present moment, seems to be unstoppable.

In this pursuit, one YouTuber, Sakshi Joshi, a former ‘journalist’ known for her shrill rhetorics against the Modi government, recently posted a video wherein she went on a bizarre rant against the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.

Joshi sarcastically commented on the construction of the Ram Mandir, suggesting that people seem to believe all problems will magically disappear just because the temple is being built in Ayodhya. In a widely circulated video on social media, Joshi mocked the idea that contributing Rs 20 crores to build the Ram Mandir would miraculously solve all woes, jokingly claiming that God will even tackle inflation simply because the temple is under construction.

Is she alright? What happened to her-broken or drunk? pic.twitter.com/mNuMYyNobC — DEEWAN. (@Spoof_Junkey) January 18, 2024

The clip is symbolic of the meltdown that the left-leaning liberals are having as the date of the Ram Mandir consecration ceremony, or the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla, as it is accurately referred to, is just days away. PM Modi, among other dignitaries, will be attending the ceremony and witness the historic moment when Lord Ram will return to his rightful abode after an exile, this time of close to 500 years.

However, what is even more interesting is the fact that Sakshi Joshi is the same ‘journalist who, until 2018, was vociferously demanding that the BJP government at the centre build a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya as it was an ‘article of faith’ for her.

During a news segment in 2018, when Joshi was associated with News 24, the ‘journalist’ scornfully mocked a BJP leader, suggesting that the party had no genuine intention of constructing a Ram Mandir and was merely leveraging the issue as a political strategy to secure victory in the 2019 elections.

‘Despite having your government in the state at the centre, if you are not building the Ram Mandir, you are not speaking anything on the ordinance, then people would start thinking that you are only using Ram Mandir as a poll strategy to win elections,” Joshi said.

‘Bring an ordinance in the parliament and build a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. We want to see a magnificent Ram Mandir in Ayodhya; it is an article of faith for us,” Joshi says in a conversation with a BJP leader in 2018, a video of which has now gone viral on the internet after her latest rant against the Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha ritual in Ayodhya.

While being a hypocrite is second nature for such usual suspects, it reflects the deep hatred they harbour for Hindus who, for the first time in five centuries, will witness one of their holiest religious shrines restored to their original owner, Lord Ram. But like the last ten years have shown, liberals’ ranting and raving has little impact on the central government or the public, who continue to view them with suspicion and treat them as sellouts working in the interests of anti-Hindu forces.

January 22, 2024, will be a historic day, marking a pivotal moment that not only saw the return of Ram Lalla to his rightful abode but also served as an inspiration for generations of Hindus to persistently seek justice for their Dharma and their Gods."

Built with an investment of Rs 1,600 crores, the 43-acre campus is Boeing’s largest such investment outside the US.

Boeing’s new campus in India will become a cornerstone for partnership with the vibrant startup, private and government ecosystem in India, and will help develop next-generation products and services for the global aerospace and defence industry.

Prime Minister today also launched the Boeing Sukanya Program that aims to support the entry of more girl children from across India into the country’s growing aviation sector. The program will provide opportunities for girls and women from across India to learn critical skills in the science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) fields and train for jobs in the aviation sector.

For young girls, the program will create STEM Labs at 150 planned locations to help spark interest in STEM careers. The program will also provide scholarships to women who are training to be pilots.

Addressing the gathering, PM Modi asserted that India aims to reduce its offshore dependence on aircraft leasing and financing and the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) in Gujarat’s GIFT City will help in realizing it.

We are working to simplify aircraft leasing. We endeavour to reduce India’s offshore dependence on aircraft leasing and financing. So, we have set up IFSCA. The benefit of this will be reaped by the entire country,” said PM Modi, after inaugurating the new state-of-the-art Boeing India Engineering and Technology Center (BIETC) campus in Bengaluru.

India today is the third largest domestic civil aviation market, with volume more than doubling in the past decade, PM Modi said.

“UDAN scheme has helped a lot. In the coming years, the domestic air traffic will further rise. Looking at such a huge demand, our airlines have placed a massive order for aircraft. India will give new energy to the global aviation market.”

To further India’s aviation market, the central government is encouraging states to reduce taxes on aviation fuel, he said.

“India will one day develop ‘aircraft of the future’ from this particular centre,” he said, congratulating Boeing management.

“Bengaluru is the city which connects aspirations with innovations and achievements. It’s the city that connects India’s tech potential to global demands. This new Global Technology Centre of Boeing will strengthen the identity of Bengaluru.” This campus is a stamp of approval for Indian talents, he added.

“This facility will help Indian youth to learn new skills in the aviation sector. Our endeavour is to raise women’s participation in all sectors,” he noted.

Talking about women’s participation in the aviation sector, 15 per cent of Indian pilots are women, which is thrice the global average.

“Be it fighter pilots or civil aviation pilots, Indian women are leading today. I can say with pride that 15 per cent of our total pilots are women. To put this into context, this is thrice the global average,” he asserted.

PM Modi also apprised the gathering that the number of operational airports in India rose from around 70 to now 150 since year 2014.

“We have not only new airports but also improved our efficiency manifold,” PM Modi added.

The latest parole, spanning 50 days, comes amidst a history of temporary releases for the controversial figure.

Previously, in November 2023, Ram Rahim Singh had been granted a 21-day parole. Prior to that, he got a 30-day parole in July, preceded by another 40-day parole in January 2023. In 2022, he was released on parole three times.

This recent parole allows Ram Rahim Singh to continue holding religious discourses online from his Barnawa ashram in Uttar Pradesh. The Dera chief, with a substantial following in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, has been granted parole multiple times for various reasons, including his appeal to visit his ailing mother and to celebrate his birthday. The total parole he got in the last 4 years is of 234 days now.

Rapist/murderer Dera chief Gurmeet Singh granted 50 days parole. That’s 234 days in last 4 years:

Shame on Haryana Govt, prison system & courts.



My take last year: pic.twitter.com/5KXMtXOEek — Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) January 19, 2024

Ram Rahim Singh’s legal troubles stem from a 2017 conviction for the rape of two women disciples, resulting in a 20-year prison sentence. In 2019, he was also convicted for the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati. Further legal woes awaited him in 2021 when he, along with four others, was convicted of conspiring to murder Dera manager Ranjit Singh.

The frequent paroles granted to Ram Rahim Singh have not been without controversy. The president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Harjinder Singh Dhami, vehemently opposed the Haryana government’s decision to grant a 21-day furlough to the Dera chief. Dhami expressed concerns, citing the serious nature of Ram Rahim Singh’s convictions for crimes such as rape and murder, and highlighted that this decision was creating mistrust within the Sikh community.

It is crucial to note that, according to the Haryana Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 2022, convicted prisoners can be granted regular parole. However, prisoners convicted of multiple murders or under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act are not eligible for parole.

In summary, the latest 50-day parole granted to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is the latest chapter in a series of temporary releases over the past four years. The reasons for paroles have varied, including family visits, birthday celebrations, and religious activities. The Dera chief enjoying frequent paroles has raised serious questions on the system and judiciary."

This conclusion is among newly unredacted information concerning the company’s child-safety standards in a lawsuit filed last month by New Mexico, which claims Meta’s platforms recommend sexual content to minors and push underage accounts to predatory adult users.

In one 2021 internal document detailed in the now-redacted documents, Meta staffers stated that one of their recommendation algorithms, known as “People You May Know,” was known to connect underage users with possible sexual predators.

According to the New Mexico lawsuit, officials were alerted to the discovery several years ago. They rejected a staff request that the business change the algorithm’s architecture, known internally as PYMK, to prevent it from recommending minors to adults.

In the report’s comments section, one Facebook worker claimed that the algorithm has previously “contributed up to 75% of all inappropriate adult-minor contact.” “How on earth have we not just turned off PYMK between adults and children?” asked another employee, according to the lawsuit. “It’s really, really upsetting.”

Meta declined to comment on the newly disclosed references to internal materials, directing the Journal to a prior statement in which it said New Mexico “mischaracterizes our work using selective quotes and cherry-picked documents.”

The corporation has referred to child predators as “determined criminals,” and has long invested in both enforcement and child safety-focused solutions for young users and parents.

New Mexico claims Meta failed to address pervasive predation on its platform or prohibit design features that promoted youngsters to adults with evil intent. The action claims that Meta wrongfully persuaded the public that its platforms were safe, rather than openly disclosing internal findings such as the 100,000 child-a-day scale of harassment.

Much of the internal conversation reported in the recently unredacted information centred on Instagram. According to papers referenced in the case, staff noted in an internal email in 2020 that the prevalence of “sex talk” to children on Instagram was 38 times higher than on Facebook Messenger in the United States, and encouraged the firm to implement stronger controls on the site.

One employee that year stated that an Apple executive had complained about his 12-year-old child being approached on Instagram. The Meta employee in charge of addressing the issue stated that “this is the kind of thing that irritates Apple to the point of threatening [sic] to remove us from the App Store,” and inquired about a date for when the firm would prohibit adults from texting kids on its platform.

According to a November 2020 presentation titled “Child Safety: State of Play,” Instagram has “minimal child safety protections” and policies surrounding “minor sexualization” are “immature.” It also cited the platform’s “minimal focus” on trafficking.

Despite recognizing the scope of the problem, New Mexico claims that Meta executives did not take measures to prevent adults from sexually soliciting children until late 2022, and they fell short of the extensive messaging limitations advised by its safety experts.

Rather than simply halting the recommendation of children’s profiles to adults, Facebook and Instagram attempted to block such recommendations to adults who had already displayed suspect behaviour towards children.

Meta’s method of limiting communication to only known questionable accounts was guaranteed to be less effective than turning off the recommendations, according to New Mexico, because both harmful adults and minors habitually lied about their age.

According to New Mexico’s complaint, Meta admitted internally in 2021 that the majority of juveniles on its platforms falsely claim to be adults, and an examination of accounts disabled for grooming children discovered that 99% of those adults failed to identify their age.

Meta formed a task force in June 2023 to investigate child-safety issues on its platforms, following a piece in The Wall Street Journal revealing that Instagram’s algorithms connected and encouraged a massive network of accounts openly dedicated to the commission and purchase of underage sex content.

Additional Journal articles published last year revealed that Meta is struggling to resolve issues on both Instagram and Facebook, where it recently adopted encryption for direct communications.

According to the Journal, the company’s safety team had long warned of the risks of enshrouding exchanges that could be used to prosecute child exploitation. Meta stated that it has spent years building safety protocols to prevent and combat abuse.

In addition to New Mexico’s lawsuit, Meta was sued in October by more than 40 other states, who said it deceived the public about the dangers its platforms pose to young people.

Meta announced this month that it would begin automatically banning hazardous content on teen Instagram and Facebook accounts, including videos and postings on self-harm, graphic violence, and eating disorders."

In an interview with the Israeli newspaper The Jerusalem Post, Al-Ameri informed that he worked for the youth channel of Al Jazeera named JeemTV in Doha.

While he was initially unaware of the sinister agenda of the Qatari mouthpiece, the realisation dawned on him in the mid-2010s. At that time, Al-Ameri’s home country of Yemen, captured by Houthis, was being bombed by a coalition of Gulf States led by UAE and Saudi Arabia.

""There’s a lot of propaganda going around there, much of it dictated by the regime itself.""



Former Al Jazeera journalist speaks to @Jerusalem_Posthttps://t.co/x7ovMVhDLK — Zvika Klein צביקה קליין (@ZvikaKlein) January 18, 2024

The two nations were also behind the ex-communication of Qatar by other Gulf States. When the civil war broke out in Yemen, the southern part of the country was sympathetic to both the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Given that Adnan Al-Ameri is of south Yemeni descent, he was roped in by Al Jazeera to garner support for Qatar.

“I presented and produced shows about technology and other subjects. I didn’t even begin to grasp anything about the political aspect of the channel but then everything changed when all the problems in the Gulf began,” the journalist told The Jerusalem Post.

I started feeling unsafe at Al Jazeera: Adnan Al-Ameri

He added, “One day the producers asked me to transfer from the children’s channel and become a news anchor for the main TV station. I refused politely at first, and then they started exerting pressure in all kinds of ways.”

Adnan Al-Ameri further emphasised, “But regardless of the temptations they tried to offer – and there were many – I still said no. Eventually, they turned from luring techniques to applying different methods of pressure, which I won’t mention here.”

With all my family and friends in the south (of Yemen), it all started to get to me, and I was starting to feel unsafe at my workplace,” he added how the hostile working condition and the Yemen civil war took a toll on his mental health.

Al Jazeera promotes Muslim Brotherhood agenda

While speaking to The Jerusalem Post, the Yemeni-British journalist pointed out how one needs to parrot the propaganda of the Muslim Brotherhood to work at Al Jazeera.

“When you work for their news channel, they need you to promote their Muslim Brotherhood agendas, and if you’re not there ideologically, they’ll make sure to buy you off,” Adnan Al-Ameri remarked.

It must be mentioned that the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist terror outfit, which was founded in Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna. It is infamous for promoting political Islam, Sharia law, violence and terrorism.

The organisation has been banned even in Muslim-majority Arab countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood is perceived as a threat to secularism, democratic values, and international security.

Co-workers at Al Jazeera supported Hamas, took directives from Qatari govt

Adnan Al-Ameri informed, “Much of the staff there are of Palestinian descent. Of course, they’re all aligned with Hamas. No Fatah loyalists are to be found there, nor anyone who doesn’t affiliate with Hamas or Qatar’s agendas…Al Jazeera also started to show support for the Houthis and their attacks.”

He also stated that the Islamist propaganda outlet took direct orders from the Qatari government. “There’s a lot of propaganda going around there, much of it dictated by the regime itself,” he pointed out.

“Ahmad Alyafei, the executive director, even had a direct telephone line to the Amiri Diwan (the sheikh’s main executive office). I witnessed several times how anchors would meet for lunch, and they were told to tweet this or say that,” Adnan Al-Ameri concluded.

It must be mentioned that Al Jazeera has been at the helm of anti-India propaganda and downplaying Islamist violence in the country."

The horrific murder was committed in January 2019 in the Bhavaninagar police station precinct in Hyderabad.

Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge CV S Sai Bhupathi also fined Imran Ul Haq Rs 10,000, according to a Hyderabad police press release. The authorities stated the case involved a brutal murder. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Zone) P Sai Chaitanya said that Imran-ul-Haq had also demanded Rs 30,000 from his wife to buy a car.

On January 6, 2019, Haq stabbed his wife in the throat with scissors, struck a hammer on her head, and inserted a screwdriver into her vagina before fleeing the scene. Based on a complaint, a case was filed under Section 302 and other relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and Haq was arrested the police said.

As per the chargesheet, victim Naseem Akhtar gave birth to four daughters, which dismayed Imran, who married another woman in the hopes of having a son. However, he stayed with Naseem and tortured her for money. Meanwhile, Naseem’s family members used to give him money to avoid problems.

Imran became accustomed to this until Naseem stood firm, stating that her family were unable to give in every time he demanded money. This infuriated Imran. Following that, while the girls were visiting their grandparents, he grabbed a set of scissors, a hammer, and a screwdriver and assaulted Naseem.

Imran attacked his wife Naseem in the neck with scissors, gouged out her eyes, and shoved a screwdriver into her vagina before fleeing the crime scene. When Naseem’s brother heard her screams, he hurried to the scene, but Imran had already escaped before he could attend to his sister. Imran then went to his second wife’s home, changed his clothes, and was leaving when the Bhavaninagar police apprehended him.

During their investigation, the police found a note blaming Naseem’s family for forcing his hand, TNIE reported. The court convicted Imran based on numerous clues and eyewitness accounts."
