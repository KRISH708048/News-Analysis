In an interview with ANI, the minister pointed to “multiple standards”.

“I’m not saying we don’t have room for improvement. Everybody does. We certainly do. But I would say, please look at their motive and their agenda. They are not agenda-less, they are not motive-less, they are trying to push a certain line because they have a certain interest, so don’t necessarily take what comes in foreign media at face value...because when you look at the multiple standards that they practice....you are talking of state of democracy in this country, give me any yardstick of democracy. Are your elections fair, is your participation growing? Are broader and broader sections involved, are your institutions working. I would say I am doing as well as any other democracy.”

The minister also said there are people “who apparently feel more confident of their support outside India, and inside India, they get support from outside India”. “So we have this constant barrage. We’ve had this from 2014, it increased up to 2019. I'm sure it will become very shrill as we lead up to the summer of 2024, who will constantly come at you and say you are less of a democracy? They’ll pick what they believe are flaws or failings that we have. Again, we must have the confidence to judge it.”

BJP ministers have repeatedly criticised the foreign press and global surveys critical of India as “mischievous” or “flawed”.

In India, every second foreign correspondent has been summoned by the Narendra Modi government to explain their reportage critical of ministries. Since August 2019, almost no one has been allowed to visit Jammu and Kashmir and report independently there. And journalists who write “negative stories” are given visas valid for less than a year, putting their jobs at stake.

Those were some of the findings of three internal surveys conducted in 2020, 2021 and 2022 among journalists in India who are either foreign nationals or who are overseas citizens of India cardholders. You can read more details in this Newslaundry report."

These are not social media comments by incels but captions to YouTube videos by NewsFirst Kannada after its cameras zoomed in on women’s outfits, faces, and bodies outside pubs in Bengaluru on new year’s eve.

Despite visible discomfort and requests to not be filmed, the Kannada news channel’s cameras continued to follow women as they left pubs. The channel’s coverage also included footage of a woman being helped into an auto rickshaw while she was drunk. “Look at the woman in auto falling on anyone in sight,” read the thumbnail.

Another woman reportedly faced molestation, and NewsFirst Kannada’s video showed the woman’s friend assaulting the alleged molester. The channel sensationalised the incident with captions such as “lover beats up man for molesting ‘his’ woman” and “molester gets free beatings by lover”.

Several other news channels such as Public TV and Zee Kannada News ran content with nearly similar visuals. The thumbnails and titles of these videos were equally misogynistic. In a video published by Public TV, the thumbnail read, “Drunk woman passed out on the road,” “Woman full tight male-friends full tired,” and “Drunk woman loses consciousness on the road”.

The comment boxes under all these videos were promptly filled with inappropriate takes on the women’s attire, “insinuating and inviting lewd behavior”.

DCP South East CK Baba said the police will probe the matter if anyone files a complaint. Meanwhile, NewsFirst Kannada has deleted some of the videos from YouTube."

While the Delhi High Court is hearing another petition challenging the status quo, a section of the media has already begun linking objections – especially those by political leaders such as AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi – to an attempt to either “appease” or “provoke” Muslims.

But architects understand that buildings are not just material; they are not just a pile of brick, mortar, and concrete. Just as a humble house has meaning for the person who builds it and lives in it, historic public structures such as the Sunehri Bagh Masjid hold even deeper meanings.

In its public notice inviting suggestions, the NDMC had pointed to an alleged need to ease up traffic congestion . And this writer wrote to the civic body on December 29 last year with the following objections and suggestions.

Recognised heritage

Sunehri Bagh Masjid is recognised heritage – it belongs to the Mughal Era and is a Grade III heritage building. India has prided itself on its heritage conservation and has reaped great economic and cultural benefits from its heritage sites. UNESCO has recognised 42 world heritage sites in India, 34 of which are cultural and three of which – Qutub Minar Complex, Red Fort and the Humayun’s Tomb – are in Delhi.

Moreover, India is a signatory to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention of 1972 and demolishing a Mughal Era Mosque that shares its period and construction with our world heritage sites would be a matter of great shame for India in the international forum. It will be a significant and adverse deviation from our culture of preservation and promotion of heritage – both built and unbuilt.

Colonised usually don’t demolish what even coloniser saved

The Sunehri Bagh Masjid is a living site of medieval history that even the British recognised. Much before its official recognition as a Grade III heritage building in 2009, the mosque has lived through histories of colonial occupation, the building of the imperial city of New Delhi by Edwin Lutyens and has been a site of history in India’s anti-colonial struggle.



Sir Edwin Lutyens was far from appreciative of the architecture of the Indian subcontinent. His objections to the inclusion of ‘Indian elements’ in the designing of New Delhi are well documented in the archives of the Royal Institute of British Architects in London and in books like Making of a Capital by Malvika Singh and Indian Summer: Lutyens Baker & Imperial Delhi by Robert Grant Irving.



But even his colonial eye did not miss the importance of Sunehri Bagh Masjid.

Despite his disdain for the architecture of the Indian subcontinent, the mosque’s heritage value was not lost on Lutyens, and he incorporated the mosque in his geometric plan for the new capital. Had it not been for this inclusion, we would have lost the mosque through the building of the new imperial centre in 1912. Several monuments of the subcontinents met the fate of demolition during the building of colonial towns and cities. Sunehri Bagh Masjid is an exception.



To demolish a structure that even our colonial occupiers recognised as valuable would be a huge betrayal to our own history. Our discourses on decolonisation and our repetition of the story of our anti-colonial struggle will lose moral currency and meaning if we demolish what even the British had saved. I cannot think of many examples where the colonised demolished what the coloniser saved. India should not be the first example of this nature.



Role in freedom struggle

The mosque is of immense importance for the history of our anti-colonial struggle. Maulana Hasrat Mohani, the freedom fighter who gave us the slogan ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ (long live revolution) and who was central to the 1930 resolution of Purna Swaraj (complete self-rule), lived in the mosque and attended Parliament from there. He denied government accommodation and travel allowance and used a bicycle and public transport to commute to work at the Parliament complex from the mosque.



The mosque is material evidence to this history and must be celebrated as such. It imbibes within its material, the history of India’s independence and the values and ethics of a frugal Parliamentarian. When one walks on the streets of London, for example, it is very common to come across plaques that mark small houses and cafes where influential states-people, writers and thinkers stayed, visited or lived. These sites are markers in the built environment that remind us of those great human beings and generate awareness and appreciation for their work.



Demolishing the Sunehri Bagh Masjid will desecrate this important history, it will rob us of a significant detail and history of a great personality from our recent past. As a post-colonial nation state, this abandonment of our own struggle will be a grave injustice for the generations to come. It is in material and objects of history that we preserve that which words cannot fully describe. Instead of demolition, the NDMC should consider placing a plaque at the mosque that reminds visitors of Maulana Hasrat Mohani.



Constant use, living heritage

Sunehri Bagh Masjid is a living heritage. One of the reasons that Edwin Lutyens conserved the mosque in his plan for New Delhi was that the mosque was in constant use. It is in active use today as well.

Living heritage carries added values of memory, sanctity, and religious sentiments. Estimates suggest that around a thousand people use the mosque every week. It is a site of prayer and an integral part of Delhi’s urbanity and urban landscape.

It is a constitutional duty under Articles 18, 25, and 26 to safeguard the religious freedom of all Indians and protect their sentiments in the secular republic that India is. Any political onslaught on such spaces in India must be resisted.

Traffic solutions

There is no need to demolish Sunehri Bagh Masjid. As per the NDMC notice and several media reports, the stated need to demolish Sunehri Bagh Masjid is ease of traffic movement. That it creates a blind spot for moving traffic, and pedestrian movement to and from the mosque creates obstruction and a potential threat.

As a trained architect who has worked on several large-scale urban design projects, I can confirm that demolishing the mosque at the roundabout is not just needless, it diminishes the history and character of the street that it crowns. However, the concerns of the traffic police must be addressed.

Monuments at roundabouts are a common feature across the world. Many countries such as France, the UK, Vietnam, Russia, Mexico and India have monuments on important roundabouts. Some roundabouts are important for being monumental.

For example, Paris’ famous monument Arc de Triomphe is a roundabout. It is much bigger than the Sunehri Bagh Masjid and is an intersection of 12 major roads of the metropolis. The Arc receives more than 1.7 million visitors every year – a number much higher than the humble 1000 people using the Sunehri Bagh Masjid weekly.

This simple comparison and many other examples that you can find, tell us two things – one, that heavy traffic around a monumental roundabout is not a threat and traffic can flow with the right design of streets and two, that pedestrian access can also be managed safely around such monuments. These monuments can form the basis for a solution to the problem that the mosque apparently poses.

Very practical, and implementable solutions are present in close vicinity to the Masjid as well.

Lutyen’s Delhi has many underpasses – the most recent ones built at the Janpath and India Gate crossings. Underpasses are a safe and convenient solution for pedestrians to cross the busiest of roads and streets and the footpaths of Lutyen’s Delhi provide plenty of space to build underpasses at this site. Another option can be footover bridges. But since footover bridges can interfere with the aesthetics of the surrounding, underpasses seem to be a good viable alternative for pedestrians to access the Masjid without hindering the movement of traffic. Pedestrian crossings operated through traffic lights are also an option.

All of these solutions will not only facilitate safe movement of people visiting the mosque but will make for an overall safer environment for the commuters of the Delhi Metro station at Udyog Bhavan as well.

The court said its power to enter the regulatory framework of SEBI is limited. “Investigative reports by press can act as inputs for SEBI but cannot be taken as credible evidence or a proof of regulatory failure by SEBI and it cannot cast doubt on the investigation being carried on by a statutory body,” it said, in a reference to a series of media reports reiterating the allegations of the Hindenburg report, according to Bar and Bench.

Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud also reportedly said there was no ground to transfer the probe.

A bench comprising CJI Chandrachud, Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra had reserved its order in November last year on petitions seeking a court-monitored probe. The court had earlier remarked that there was no material to doubt the investigation carried out by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The bench also dismissed doubts about the impartiality of the members of the expert committee constituted by the court to examine the issue.

It should be noted here that none of these posts were made after the alleged crime.

While Kunal Pandey and Saksham Patel were the coordinator and co-coordinator of the BJP IT cell’s Varanasi unit, Abhishek Chauhan was also part of the same unit.

The three were arrested in the early hours of Sunday over the incident which allegedly took place in November last year. According to a report in The Indian Express , the accused are learnt to have told the police that they were involved in three other cases of molestation on campus.

While several opposition leaders have tried to target the BJP over ostensible links of the accused to the party, BJP Varanasi (Mahanagar) president Vidyasagar told The Indian Express that the three are no longer members of the party’s IT cell in Varanasi.

While the Facebook pages of Pandey, who is married to the daughter of a BJP leader, and Chauhan are now locked, Newslaundry found that Saksham Patel’s social media profile had a series of pictures with the BJP brass – posted in 2022.

On Facebook, Saksham Patel claimed to be a co-convener of the Varanasi IT cell. With over 1,300 Facebook friends, he actively posted on the profile from January to September, 2022.

A picture posted by him in April 2022 shows him in RSS uniform, wishing people “Hindu New Year”.

On January 4, he uploaded a profile picture with BJP president JP Nadda, and on January 30, he uploaded a picture with Adityanath.

Patel has also posted twice about his meetings with the BJP Union Minister Anurag Thakur – first on January 22 and then on March 2 .

Within a period of six months, he posted six pictures with UP Jal Shakti minister Swatantra Dev Singh.

The same day he posted a picture with JP Nadda, he uploaded another profile picture with Swatantra Dev Singh. Around 10 days later, he posted another picture with the BJP leader, congratulating him on being elected as BJP UP Head. The next week, he posted a picture of Singh surrounded by girls to wish his followers the National Girl Child Day.

In February , he posted a collage of pictures of his meetings with Singh to wish him on his birthday. And in March , he uploaded a picture showing him sitting with Singh to congratulate him on his induction as a UP cabinet minister. In August , he posted about another meeting with the minister.

Of all the BJP leaders, Patel has posted the highest number of photographs with Varanasi BJP MLA Saurabh Srivastava. Nine times.

Right before the UP assembly elections in February 2022, he posted eight pictures with Srivastava , campaigning for him . On February 7, he uploaded a profile picture with the leader. On February 16, he posted several pictures from his election rally which he was part of. On March 7 , he uploaded another photo, stating that it was the first time had voted for Srivastava. On April 5 , he uploaded another picture in which the BJP MLA can be seen greeting him by placing a scarf around Patel’s neck.

In August , Patel was also allegedly part of PM Modi’s Har Ghar Tiranga Programme with Srivastava. And in January , Patel was also part of a flag hoisting ceremony at Modi’s office in Varanasi on the occasion of Republic Day.

In January, 2022, he also posted twice about his meeting with BJP Gujarat general secretary Ratnakar."

The article, which appears to be written by an author who may not be familiar with the functioning of the courts or stepped foot within the precincts of the Supreme Court, intends to highlight the dichotomy between the “words” and “deeds” of the present Chief Justice of India in 2023.

In that article, the “words” spoken by the Chief Justice of India were a reference to the various lectures delivered by him, and the “deeds” were decisions rendered by him, sitting with other judges in the Supreme Court of India.

To extract the thoughts expressed by a judge in a lecture on a particular topic, and to selectively apply them to certain matters, is too simplistic an understanding of the true workings of the judicial system. The article in question has skipped the very fundamentals of judicial decision-making – the individuality of the facts of each case, the sound legal principles applicable, practice and procedure of the Supreme Court, and the constitutional goal to do complete justice.

The words chosen to critique the judgments of the Chief Justice, particularly the references to the Chief Justice of India as being armed with an immaculate “pedigree”, and of “wearing a cloak of progressiveness like no other in the judiciary”, do little to buttress any legal argument and stray into the area of a rant. This is especially so considering the emphasis on specifics in courts of law as compared to column space in news.

After the reference to the Chief Justice’s lectures on democracy, the article comes to the central point it attempts to highlight – the matter of Umar Khalid’s bail. To begin with, the article misleads that Umar Khalid’s bail petition was deferred on multiple occasions by the Chief Justice, by stating that the “CJI’s court” adjourned the matter on various dates.

The matter was, in fact, listed before another bench, of which the Chief Justice was not a member. That bench had unquestionably attempted to hear the case, while accommodating the requests for adjournment made by the parties, including by the lawyers of Umar Khalid himself.

The article in question also fails to mention that when the matter was listed on July 24, 2023, a letter for adjournment was circulated on behalf of Umar Khalid. On the next date, August 9, one of the judges on the bench recused from the matter. On the following date, the matter was adjourned simpliciter.

On September 5, a request for adjournment was again made on behalf of Umar Khalid. Thereafter, on September 12, the Supreme Court granted ‘leave’ in the matter to facilitate its hearing on non-miscellaneous days. On the following date, the court directed that the matter be listed in the first five items, again, with the intention of concluding its hearing.

Lastly, on November 29, a joint request for adjournment was made, including on the part of Umar Khalid’s legal team, to adjourn the matter, due to non-availability of the arguing counsel. None of these delays can be said to be attributable to the Supreme Court, and in no manner to the Chief Justice of India.

The over-simplification of the adjournments in the Umar Khalid matter, and the blanket statement of the article attributing all adjournments to the “CJI’s court” do not appreciate much of the detailing and complexity which the author still may have issues with, but then could at least be directed more accurately. It also reflects why researching the details in matters of the court is imperative for a rational critique.

To highlight the plight of numerous undertrial prisoners, the article retains its spotlight on only one undertrial prisoner, Umar Khalid, without any supporting statistics to show the actual disposal of other bail applications by the Supreme Court.

In fact, the Chief Justice of India has on numerous occasions constituted benches on non-working days and holidays, in matters where the personal liberty of individuals is in grave danger.

For example, the hearing of Teesta Setalvad’s bail application took place on a Saturday, and even the larger bench was constituted that very evening, after the disagreement between two judges. Likewise, a bench was specially constituted on December 19 last year when the court had already commenced its winter vacation to hear a matter from the Allahabad High Court, where the Vice Chancellor of the Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences was directed to surrender.

Apart from the above, there have been numerous instances where the bench of the Chief Justice of India has taken out of turn mentionings in matters of personal liberty, and passed orders protecting individuals from unwarranted arrests. It is not the purport of this response to list many such orders which have been passed, but had the author of the article in question undertaken a thorough statistical exercise, she would have certainly come across several such orders.

The takeaway from the above is that the doors of justice in the Supreme Court are always open, especially when it concerns the personal liberty of an individual. Whether a person succeeds or not in persuading a bench to grant an order depends on a complex mix of circumstances, especially the facts of each case, and certainly the Chief Justice of India cannot be blamed for orders passed by other benches of the court, since he is only the primus inter pares.

The article also goes on to glorify the emerging trend of browbeating judges by some practising advocates, which in my view is highly unbecoming of this profession. These attacks multiply in number, especially when any self-proclaimed “sensitive” matter is listed before a judge against whom such persons have preconceived notions.

There are hundreds of lawyers in the Supreme Court who quietly go about arguing their cases before the benches to which such cases are assigned. It is not part of a lawyer’s duty to seek that his matter be listed before a particular bench, or that it be removed from a bench before which it is listed.

The Chief Justice, being the master of the roster, had recently responded to these unsubstantiated claims of certain matters being listed before certain honourable judges, stating that if a matter is listed before a judge, it is for the said judge to take a call. This is the correct position, and this practice has been followed since the establishment of the Supreme Court of India. The pressures on the judicial system are best understood by those in it.

Another concerning aspect is the ill considered comment made regarding one of the sitting judges’ professional history of being the law secretary to a particular government in the past. Such remarks which have become frequent in the age of social media throw responsibility to the wind, and are often used to intimidate a judge who has been discharging her judicial functions for over 27 years.

The people of India, through the Constitution, repose complete faith in the independence of a judge from the moment they take oath.

Targeting judges does little to nudge the discourse toward any kind of judicial reform and more toward a social media fuelled free-for-all. If conversations around the judiciary have to be productive, they have to take into account legal specifics and be accurate which will lead to a better and complete understanding in the public domain.

In his defamation complaint in a Gurgaon court in 2008, Rathee had accused 18 major newspapers, particularly mentioning a news item in the The Indian Express titled “Accused says he bribed ADGP, sought police protection”.

The report had mentioned that an accused had allegedly confessed before the CBI that Rathee had recommended police protection to them after taking a bribe. It had also explicitly carried Rathee’s denial.

Besides Grewal, the proceedings have been quashed for Indian Express’s former resident editor Vipin Pubby, and news dailies Ajit and Ajit Samachar managing editor Barjinder Singh Hamdard, among others.

The court said that the newspapers and their reporters had not committed an offence by publishing news reports on Rathee.

The court said: “A complete reading of the news, which contained the complainant’s rebuttal, his version, the version of the police, can be stated to have been published in good faith and discharge of their functions in a democracy, and if restrictions are created to publish such news, it would be just like killing a mockingbird.”

The single-judge observed that courts must be more vigilant and proactive while safeguarding the interests of journalists, and that in the “fearless pursuit of their duties”, brave journalists face pressures from influential parties or government agencies.

The court said the journalists had adhered to all ethical standards of reasonableness and impartiality."

The court was earlier scheduled to pronounce its judgment on December 1 last year. And on December 1, it decided to defer its verdict until January 5, 2024.

The new IT Rules gives the government “unfettered power” in absence of any “guidelines and guardrails”, the Bombay High Court had observed in September last year while hearing petitions challenging the amendments.

The division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Neela Gokhale had also questioned the government over the need for the amendment and the provision for a separate fact check unit despite the establishment of the Press Information Bureau fact check.

“You have a PIB which has its presence on social media. Why then was this amendment required and (the need) for an FCU to be set up? I think this amendment wants to do something more,” asked Justice Patel. Pointing out that the government was the “sole arbiter without any checks and balances”, he had emphasised the need to set up guidelines.

Representing the government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said the PIB’s fact check unit was “teethless”.

“The IT Rules are not related to curbing free speech at all. The government is not trying to proscribe and prohibit any expression of opinion, criticism, or comparative analysis...in fact we welcome them, encourage them and learn from them,” he had said, adding that the rules have “nothing to do with humour or satire…as far as the content does not cross the line”.

The petitions were filed by stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra, the Editors Guild of India and the Association of Indian Magazines, terming the rules as arbitrary and unconstitutional.

The amendment, originally notified on April 6 last year, said social media companies and other intermediaries must take down content deemed fake by a government fact-check unit. It was widely criticised by press groups, opposition leaders and journalists. Kamra’s plea, filed a few days later, said the rules “have a chilling effect and are enough to chill people”."

The OCCRP reports had tried to establish allegations of stock manipulation by the Adani Group and lapses on part of SEBI. Days before they were published, the Adani Group had hit out at an “extended campaign” to “advance vested interests”, to imply a bias in the investigation.

The reports were also part of the petitions before the Supreme Court which sought a court-monitored SIT probe. Investigative reports by the press can act as inputs for SEBI but cannot be taken as credible evidence or a proof of regulatory failure by SEBI and it cannot cast doubt on the investigation being carried on by a statutory body, the top court said on Wednesday while dismissing the petitions.

“To assail the adequacy of SEBI’s investigation thus far, the petitioner has sought to rely on a report published by OCCRP and various newspapers referring to the report. The petitioner’s case appears to rest solely on inferences from the report by the OCCRP, a third-party organisation involved in ‘investigative reporting’. The petitioners have made no effort to verify the authenticity of the claims,” the order said.

“The reliance on newspaper articles or reports by third-party organisations to question a comprehensive investigation by a specialised regulator does not inspire confidence. Such reports by ‘independent’ groups or investigative pieces by newspapers may act as inputs before SEBI or the Expert Committee. However, they cannot be relied on as conclusive proof of the inadequacy of the investigation by SEBI. Nor, as the petitioners state, can such inputs be regarded as “credible evidence”. The veracity of the inputs and their sources must be demonstrated to be unimpeachable. The petitioners cannot assert that an unsubstantiated report in the newspapers should have credence over an investigation by a statutory regulator whose investigation has not been cast into doubt on the basis of cogent material or evidence,” stated the order by the bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra.

Newslaundry had republished the OCCRP story on August 31 last year, an investigation into alleged stock manipulation by four Adani companies between 2013 and 2017.

Last year, billionaire hedge fund investor Soros was in the eye of a political storm in India with his comments on the Narendra Modi government and the Adani Group. Predictably enough, a large section of TV media chose to follow the government’s line about the billionaire’s remarks being an “attack on India” and took it a notch up – Soros, BBC, Hindenburg were described as part of an international ‘tukde tukde’ gang with local support from who else but Indian liberals and Opposition parties.

Ex-post facto approval is the assent given to projects that have already begun or have been completed, ostensibly as a leeway. Such approvals were issued through the environment ministry’s office memorandums on July 7, 2021 and January 28, 2022.

The entities that operated projects without prior environment clearance in violation of the Environment Impact Assessment notification, 2006, before getting the ex-post facto approval, included leading construction and mining players besides public sector firm NBCC.

The top court’s order came on Tuesday in the hearing of a writ petition filed by environmental NGO Vanshakti. However, while the NGO’s plea mentioned the 11 companies, advocate Vanshdeep Dalmia, representing the NGO said: “The list is illustrative, not exhaustive.”

Of the 11 entities, eight were operational without a prior environment clearance, ostensibly at an unaccounted cost to the ecology and environment. The longest a company ran its operation without the EC approval was for 12 years, and two years was the shortest.

The other three firms violated the EIA norms for “excess” use of the built-up area and overshooting production of minerals. The projects were located in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Haryana, Kerala and Odisha.

Notably, the breather for these companies was ratified by the expert appraisal committees or EACs of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, state bodies such as state environment impact assessment authorities, and state expert appraisal committees.

How were the companies given backdoor breathers?

In 2017, the environment ministry issued a notification to give ex-post facto environment clearance approvals to violators – a “one-time window” for six months.

In July 2021, it released a standard operating procedure through an office memorandum to implement the notification again. This came after the National Green Tribunal directed the “concerned authorities” to formulate SOP for EC in cases of violations.

The petitioner argued that the notification expired on April 13, 2018, but the state and central appraisal committees treated the 2021 SOP as a “substantive procedure to process fresh applications for grant of ex-post facto environment clearance”.

This was amid the pandemic, when the environment ministry brought a slew of amendments to the environmental laws.

Between March 2020 and March 2022, the Union environment ministry issued 123 “instruments,” as per a study by Delhi-based think tank Vidhi - Centre for Legal Policy . These instruments were gazette notifications, office memorandums, circulars, letters and orders. Every third instrument, and a total of 39, was found to be amendments made to various rules and notifications under the EP Act and the EIA notification.

Three-fourths of the 39 amendments were relaxations and exemptions from the pre-existing laws, as per the study titled ‘(De)Regulating the Environment — An Analysis of Regulatory Changes Introduced during COVID-19 in India’.

A week after the 2021 SOP, the Madras High Court stayed it. The court called it “ultra-virus,” translating to beyond the powers of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and the EIA notification, 2006. In December 2021, the Supreme Court limited the HC order to its jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court order read: “The interim stay passed by the Madras High Court can have no application to operating of the Standard Operating Procedure to projects in territories beyond the territorial jurisdiction of Madras High Court.”

A month later, in January 2022, the environment ministry, quoting the SC order, issued an office memorandum. Calling it “self-explanatory”, the ministry mentioned the stay imposed by the HC and the restriction of its order by the SC. This, according to the petitioner, was also used by state and central bodies to admit fresh applications of violators.

The petitioner further claimed that these new changes flouted section 3 of the EP Act. “It’s submitted that as per the purport of Section 3 (of the EP Act) only positive amendments can be made and no retrograde/regressive steps ought to take place and thus the impugned (under challenge) OM dated 07.07.2021 would have been ultra-vires the provisions of Section 3 itself,” read the petition.

Section 3 reads: “Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government, shall have the power to take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing controlling and abating environmental pollution.”

Senior advocate Gopal Sankarnarayan, who argued on behalf of the NGO, said the Supreme Court had sought a reply from the environment ministry. “The case will be heard in three-four weeks,” he told Newslaundry.

Who are the violators?

Sankarnarayan said if a project was operating without environment clearance, it had to be dismantled in accordance with the 2006 EIA notification. But the 2021 SOP prevented it.

The 11 entities that violated the EIA notification before getting the ex-post facto approval included a public sector unit, a leading iron and steel manufacturer, and a real estate developer.

An iron ore project by iron and steel manufacturing major Llyods Metals and Energy Limited was given an ex-post facto approval after operating a mine in Maharashtra’s Naxal-affected Gadchiroli district without the environment clearance for 12 years.

The company received the approval by the EAC of the environment ministry in its meeting on December 27-28, 2022. It levied Rs 26.64 crore in “damage assessment” and Rs 5.48 crore “in penalty provisions” in accordance with the 2021 office memorandum.

The 2021 SOP mandated a penalty of 0.25 percent of the total turnover for violation period in addition to 1 percent of the total project cost.

Notably, Union Home Minister Amit Shah was scheduled to inaugurate a plant of Lloyds in the district on December 9 last year.

In Gurgaon, Unitech Limited built a commercial office complex, Signature Tower-III, in excess of built-up area permitted in its environment clearance granted in 2012.

As per the environment norms , the company was allowed to carry out construction up to 86,802 square meters, but it overshot by 18,698 square meters. The environment impact assessment authority of Haryana imposed a penalty of Rs 1.24 crore and Rs 1.99 crore in environment damage assessment on the company.

NBCC (India) Ltd, a central government navratna undertaking, was one of the beneficiaries of the 2022 notification. It was building a residential project in Kerala’s Ernakulam district spread over 31,307 square meters.

In Telangana, Ganesh Metal Industries and GI Rank Industries continued open cast mining in Sangareddy district for seven and 10 years without the environment clearance.

Real estate firm JAS Construction Private Limited expanded a residential complex in Odisha’s Sambalpur district in 2018 without the environment clearance.

In Andhra Pradesh, Sri Krishna Mohan Stone continued open cast mining for eight years in Vizianagaram district without the environment certificate. It was given the EC by Andhra Pradesh EIA authority in January 2023 under the environment ministry’s relaxation rules.

In the same district, another company, Jetty Satyanarayana and others, carried out mining in an area spread across 4.7 hectares for eight years without approval. A mining lease holder, B Asha, also mined another area for seven years without the EC.

Vinay Alloys in Maharashtra’s Nagpur began constructing an alloy plant in 2021 without approval. In its meeting in May 2023, the EAC granted post facto certificate by imposing a penalty of Rs 4 lakh."

The court said the senior journalist had “no personal knowledge of the victim’s caste,” Livelaw reported.

Kishore, the media channel’s camera person Mritunjay Kumar and car driver Parmeshwar Singh were arrested and booked under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and for alleged rash driving in Punjab’s Ludhiana. The three were released on interim bail a day after their arrest.

The case was lodged after a woman’s hand was injured when their vehicle allegedly hit her. The accused allegedly used casteist slurs against the woman who belonged to the SC/ST community.

However, Times Now Navbharat had claimed that the arrests came after a series of “orchestrated events”. The media organisation alleged that Kishore was held without the presence of woman police personnel after sunset and denied legal and telephone access. Kishore subsequently moved the high court challenging the FIR.

The channel said that there was a brawl when the trio was on its way to cover an AAP event hosted by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart Bhagwat Mann in Ludhiana. It claimed that a group of women in an e-rickshaw hit the vehicle into the journalist’s car, pointing to the possibility of them being “motivated AAP workers”. It also alleged that the police action could be because of the channel’s coverage of Kejriwal’s official residence.

The court verdict comes nearly two months after the HC quashed the FIR in the matter against cameraman Kumar.

The court said: “It remains undisputed that the accused/petitioner had no personal knowledge of the victim's or her family's caste. As such, the court cannot presume that the accused was aware of the victim's caste or tribal identity.”

The arrest of the media persons and the car driver had drawn sharp criticism from several journalist associations, who had hit out at the police for booking the reporter under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and for alleged rash driving."

In the “mega exclusive” interview part of the show The Right Side, the prominent seer reiterated the significance of caste in the Hindu faith and the potential of India to become a Hindu state while the journalist listened to him intently, without any cross-questioning. The tickers read “decodes the ‘real’ Hindu”, “a Hindu rashtra possible?”, and “Hindu, Hindutva, Hindustan”.

On Narasimhan’s question about caste superiority and whether one could be a Brahmin by deed, the Hindu religious leader pointed to a “story in Mahabharata”. “A Kshatriya had made a lot of efforts but later on he attained the supreme state only after being born in a Brahmin clan.”

“Acharya to bhagwaan ke ghar se Brahmin ko hi praapt hai…updesh keval Brahmin hi de sakte hain,” said the Shankaracharya, reiterating the belief that only Brahmins can impart spiritual wisdom.

The anchor asked if one could change their varna through actions because this is what triggers the “most frustration” in social sections. “Vidurji (a figure from the Mahabharata) was not considered a Brahmin, but he could adopt the conduct and behavior befitting a Brahmin. But one cannot marry a Brahmin’s daughter,” said the seer.

Narasimhan then moved on to ask the seer about the concept of a Hindu nation. “Some people say that India should be declared a Hindu nation. Some say that then it will become majoritarian…you think it is not wrong to declare India as a Hindu nation?”

“True, but who will do it?” asked Shankaracharya. “According to today’s Constitution, the Prime Minister can do all this. Is all that within his limits? Can’t do it even if you want to. All that work is for us. That is why an environment for this should be created first…Eighty percent of the work is done by creating sentiment and creating an environment…Twenty percent of the work is done through struggle.”

Such shows in the mainstream media on the caste system are not a surprise considering the fact that it’s dominated by the upper castes.

In 2019, there were zero journalists from SC or ST backgrounds in leadership positions in India’s mainstream media newsrooms, spanning print, broadcast and digital.

In 2022, that number still stood at zero.

This was one of the findings of Who Tells Our Stories Matters: Representation of Marginalised Caste Groups in Indian Media . A joint effort by Newslaundry and Oxfam India, this annual report since 2019 has scrutinised caste representation in Indian newsrooms. The latest research was conducted between April 2021 and March 2022.

The three-judge bench had also made two key observations.

First, that the Hindenburg report should not be held as “ipso facto true state of affairs”.

The bench, which also comprised justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, observed : “We don’t have to treat what is set out in the Hindenburg report as ipso facto (automatically) true state of affairs. That is why we directed the SEBI to investigate. Because for us to accept something which is in the report of an entity, which is not before us and whose veracity we have no means of testing, would really be unfair.”

The second remark was a caution against giving unexamined credence to media reports alleging Adani group of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud.

“I don’t think you can ask a statutory regulator to take as gospel truth something which is filed in a newspaper, whether in The Guardian or The Financial Times”, remarked the CJI-headed bench while reserving its order.

Early this week, the reflection of these two remarks could be seen in the line of reasoning the Supreme Court took in its 46-page verdict dismissing the demands for transferring the probe from SEBI to other investigative agencies, like the CBI, or constituting an SIT for the purpose.

While rejecting the pleas, the court approved market regulator SEBI’s 22 investigations into the accusations against Adani group, and directed that the remaining two probes be completed within three months.

In setting aside the doubts raised by petitioners over SEBI’s probe, the court was of the clear view that casting such aspersions was not rooted in evidence, and the facts of the case “do not warrant a transfer of investigation from SEBI”. Additionally, by saying that SEBI’s probe into the matter “inspires confidence” and is prima facie comprehensive, the bench batted for the market regulator’s investigative integrity.

The court order had two important elements whose relevance extends to some recurrent themes of political contention often surfacing in litigation.

Primarily, the pleas for having one’s pick of probe agencies, with wilful preference for one entity while arbitrarily discrediting the other, has been a practice seen over the decades.

In this case, the court has seen no valid ground for reinforcing such institutional scepticism. In the process, the bench has batted for the institutional mandate and expertise of the SEBI in conducting the probe, unless otherwise proved. The progress of the probe till now, in the bench’s view, hasn’t given any reason to turn sceptical gaze towards the robustness of investigation.

It is in this context that the court chose to remind the petitioners about the agency’s institutional status and conduct.

The court placed SEBI at the centre of the relevant institutional mechanism to probe allegations of stock market manipulation, or of other such malpractices or fraud. It said: “SEBI’s wide powers, coupled with its expertise and robust information-gathering mechanism, lend a high level of credibility to its decisions as a regulatory, adjudicatory and prosecuting agency.”

It is also clear that the judgement also steered clear of assertions made on the basis of conjectures. Thus, the bench didn’t allow attributing speculative intentions to the policy decisions of the SEBI as an institution, like SEBI’s amendments in the Foreign Portfolio Investors Regulations and Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements.

Refusing to see it as any alleged design, the court was critical of such a suggestion. “In effect, this court is being asked to replace the powers given to the SEBI by the Parliament as a delegate of the legislature with the petitioners’ better judgement’,’ said the bench.

Another important element is the court’s critical scrutiny of the source of information which petitioners used in their arguments – OCCRP findings and media reports.

In its judgement, the court suggested that authenticity of such information cannot be taken for granted, and there was lack of efforts on the part of petitioners to verify the veracity of claims made in such reports.

“The reliance on newspaper articles or reports by third-party organisations to question a comprehensive investigation by a specialised regulator doesn’t inspire confidence. Such reports by independent groups or investigative pieces by newspapers may act as inputs before the SEBI or the Expert Committee. However, they can’t be relied on as conclusive proof of the inadequacy of the investigation by the SEBI. Nor, as the petitioners state, can such inputs be regarded as ‘ credible evidence,” said the top court.

This seems an important reminder in times when a wide array of reports published in the news media and other entities are used as political tools to meet partisan ends. There has to be due diligence in verifying ‘facts’ presented by them because one cannot be sure of their method, competence and finally, their intentions.

The exercise of judicial scrutiny implies a certain degree of rigour in which such reports cannot be arbiters of, and far less the sole source of, establishing facts.

Within a political context, the subtext of establishing crony capitalism – ties between the favoured corporations and the ruling dispensation – has been part of the oppositional narrative in India, particularly in the last two decades. So, in the midst of contentious claims and reports, the judicial process has to be alert to fact-verifying processes when institutions like SEBI are sought to be discredited on the basis of a third-party findings or reports in a section of news media.

In giving the judicial nod of approval to the SEBI probe, the Supreme Court has reasserted the primacy of institutional mandate and expertise of the country's stock market regulator over third-party entities, media chatter and an array of insinuations. In doing so, the court was clear in stating that the petitioners were devoid of a key element in asking for transfer of probe – credible facts."

These promotional vehicles further exacerbate the religious fervour for government jobs. They paint these jobs as idealistic and life-changing but hardly mention corruption or politics.

I love your podcast because of the diverse voices. Some are cynical, others are optimistic, and some approach serious issues with dry humour.

Finally, concerning “Peterson chap”, Mr Abhinandan, he is not an admirer of Andrew Tate. Secondly, regarding his commentary on “western society being termed male-dominated” and not “misogyny”, I have shared a link . You can make up your own mind regarding his views, but labelling someone a “trad” and a “frustrated loser” is not how I would approach anyone I don't agree with.

Abhinandan, today I renewed my NL subscriber and thereafter learned that you will stop NL Hafta (on NL app podcast) as well as Daily Dose (on Apple Podcasts). The timing as well as the decision is disappointing. I additionally consumed only NL Tippani (on YouTube). NL as well as TNM hardly cover west India. The scalability of my model worked for me from my time availability perspective. I guess I will have to move on and find a different source of poison for daily/weekly news. RIP Rs 3,000.

(Note from editor: NL is not stopping NL Hafta.)

Hi NL team, a rather not so serious question.

Anytime an IT professional is involved in a piece of news, the word ‘techie’ is used lazily even in articles where the profession is not relevant. Can we please stop this lazy nicknames? Do we IT professionals need to protest? Why do journalists resort to this? I would love to hear Dhanya’s views on this next time she is on the podcast since Bangalore papers are much more guilty of this.

Cheers and keep up the good work.

On the topic of Raman sir’s movie suggestion Killers of the Flower Moon, it is good to read this article by David Dayen in The American Prospect. It explains how popular media can unwittingly diminish the scale of actual tragedy by limited or misrepresentation.

To me, one of the most disappointing journalistic voices of the Palestine-Israel so-called “war” has been that of Barkha. Given her reputable history of objective journalism, I found her coverage to be very disappointing if not (un)intentionally sanitising Israel's atrocities. Notwithstanding her name-sake objective piece in Hindustan Times , following her Mojo Story channel’s contemporaneous YT feeds will tell you a completely different story.

Time may tell that she had been on the “liberal” side of history – the side for whom ideology supersedes moral fairness or justice. The side that has long blinded us to the following questions:

Why are we only made to hate Hitler for gassing the Jews while we are tacitly asked to look away at the US action of nuking Hiroshima?

Why are we made to empathise with Ukranians rising against Russian invasion as a virtuous act of self-defense while being made to demonise Palestinians as terrorists for standing up to 75 years of oppression?

While we should not shy away from condemning any act of transgression by any of the above defending parties (be it Palestinians, or Ukrainians, or Jews against Nazis), it is utterly naive if not malicious to not contextualise such transgressions as coming from the victims of heinous oppression. The concerns put forward by Barkha, Shekhar, or their likes – that such contextualisation sanitises all acts of terrorism can be resolved by the application of the law of contract/tort concepts like direct causation, proximity, remoteness/reasonable foreseeability to the subject matter.

The atrocities that the people of Palestine were subject to in the form of blockading of Gaza, colonisation/occupation of the West Bank, and illegal and torturous detention of Palestinian citizens including minors and young children by the Israeli government/forces even before the October 7 event is very much a contemporary event and not just a historical injustice that happened in the recent/distant past.

Under these vicious circumstances, it is not only foreseeable but also reasonable that a population that is being subject to these atrocities will try to naturally resist the heinous acts in some form or the other. It is not hard to see that the foregoing events act as direct causation to the violent resistance manifested by Hamas on October 7. By the look of it, there does seem to have been a lot of transgressions committed by Hamas but any journalist worth his/her salt should not have fallen for Israeli propaganda and their lies of grossly exaggerating them.

This is exactly what Barkha is guilty of and it is hard for me to believe that she did not see through the propaganda, especially when it was not difficult even for a layperson to see through Israel’s genocide motives behind its gross exaggerations of the alleged transgressions.

I surely do not know what happened on October 7 but I found this report by Chris Hedges to be more reliable. He is joined by Max Blumenthal of The Grayzone to offer an alternative explanation: “that in its fervor to defeat Hamas, Israeli commanders may have willingly targeted and sacrificed Israeli soldiers and civilians in the crossfire” (“the Hannibal directive”).

Newslaundry’s overall coverage of the subject and the views of the Hafta panel, despite the differences, are both heartening and laudable, in particular that of Jayashree with whom I seem to agree the most.

I would like to respond to Abhinandan’s views on the conflict history of the conflict by quoting Dr Tim Winter (aka Abdul Hakim Murad): “The Palestinians are the paschal lamb slaughtered on the rock of Jerusalem to atone for 20 centuries of Christian (Europe’s) antisemitism!”

I would like to recommend the discussion of Dr Rashid Khalidi’s book, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine, with journalist Chris Hedges and Pres. Hamza Yusuf of the Zaytuna College, which is a Muslim liberal arts college.

I would also like to recommend the various interviews given by Norman Finkelstein (can be found on YouTube) in the aftermath of October 7. Coming from a family of Holocaust victims, it has never been difficult for him to consistently call out the injustices meted out to the Palestinian population, and much kudos to him for that!

I will be willing to participate in the Let’s Talk About that you plan to host on the subject matter if the slots are still open.

PS: Thank you NL for always speaking truth to power!

Happy New Year, NL team!

I hope this message finds you all well.

In discussing unemployment, Anand’s perspective overlooks underemployment in India. While I agree with his points, the prolonged higher education duration (need for multiple degrees to get a decent job) pushes individuals towards government jobs for stability. I propose a nuanced discussion on Indian unemployment, emphasising policies aligning service sector jobs with educational backgrounds. Our education system allows aspiration but lacks adequate employment opportunities, leading to a preference for government jobs for upward mobility. The private sector in India isn’t necessarily inclusive when it comes to employing and promoting people from marginalised backgrounds.

Meanwhile, our usual suspects are still at it. Aaj Tak’s Sudhir Choudhary rubbished the claims of inflation and joblessness by showing data on liquor sales of last week. On News18 India, Anand Narsimhan was busy discussing the features and benefits of caste with Shankaracharya.

As the Supreme Court’s Adani verdict came out, we saw Republic’s Arnab Goswami overshadow even NDTV’s Vishnu Som in his pitch to defend Adani.

The editor’s contact was saved as “infiltrator journo Ajit Dubey”.

Dubey entered these groups “by hiding his identity,” said a source in the Ministry of Defence. The message to “remove him” was being sent to almost all of the army’s groups, they said. “It has also reached the personal WhatsApp groups of officers.”

Newslaundry spoke to the officers of at least five such groups, while the defence ministry source said Dubey was ousted from at least a dozen WhatsApp groups of army personnel.

The message in these groups said: “This guy is an ANI journalist who has been frequently infiltrating army WhatsApp groups.

It was a loan taken by her husband, who worked with the Assam education department and died about two decades ago in an accident.

“The department told her that it can’t be done until she got some papers signed by the concerned authority where the accident had taken place. But for nearly six months, she had been running from pillar to post to get these documents approved. Then she approached us and I decided to help her,” Medhi told Newslaundry.

“He went there with proper permission from DC to take a byte. But as he was asking questions, the DC assaulted Medhi inside the chamber saying who was he to ask questions,” NB News editor Bhuyan told Newslaundry.

Medhi claimed that among the questions he asked was a query about the denial of public access to toilets in the DC office. “A lady constable humiliated the woman with words like ‘use your brain’ when she asked the constable about the toilet. So I asked the DC why officials in the office misbehave with people this way and why they have closed the public toilet. The second thing that I asked was why people have to come to the office again and again to get their work done,” he claimed.

In response to his question, Medhi claimed that the bureaucrat said the delay might be due to some officials being on leave. “We did not expect to get this kind of response.”

However, officials from the DC’s office denied there was any assault and said that after the issue involving the elderly woman was resolved, Medhi re-entered the bureaucrat’s chamber without permission and started to ask the same question about the toilet repeatedly. Both sides then got agitated and the police were called to take the journalist away, they claimed.

However, Medhi claimed he had re-entered Shah’s office only with permission. He alleged that the police “dragged me out of the office like a thief or dacoit. They made me sit in the police station for no reason till 10 pm. Later, some official came and took my statement and allowed me to leave.”

Sushmita Goswami said if the journalist was at fault, “the DC could have registered an FIR and got him arrested. All this shows high-handedness of the district administration.”"

Hamza Dahdouh, who was a journalist in his 20s, was killed in the western part of Khan Younis along with journalist Mustafa Thuraya when the vehicle they were travelling in near al-Mawasi, a supposedly safe area towards the southwest, was reportedly struck by a missile.

The vehicle came under attack while the two journalists were trying to interview displaced Palestinians, according to Al Jazeera .

Few names resonate with the resilience of Al Jazeera’s Wael Dahdouh, whose life and career has emerged as a testament to the perils faced by Palestinian journalists trying to report on the conflict. After his wife, son, daughter, and grandson were killed in October, he returned to his work the same day, determined to tell the stories of Palestinian displacement and Israel’s brutal bombings. Even after he was injured in December, he resumed reporting immediately.

After his eldest son Hamza’s death, he seemed slightly resigned. “Hamza was everything to me, the eldest boy, he was the soul of my soul… these are the tears of parting and loss, the tears of humanity,” he said. But he resumed reporting hours later.

Hamza had one million followers on Instagram. His final post before he was killed was about his father, two days before his death. “You are steadfast and patient, father. Do not despair of God’s mercy. Be certain that he will reward you well for being patient,” he wrote, with a picture of his father wearing a press helmet.

Last week, he posted a video on behalf of his deceased younger brother Mahmoud, who was killed in October. “Don’t be sad father, be strong and expose them,” said the voice-over."

A bench of Justices BV Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan had on October 12 last year reserved the matter for judgment .

The convicts were garlanded and handed sweets, having served over 15 years in jail. They were released after one of them moved the Supreme Court with a plea for premature release. The apex court had then asked the Gujarat government to consider a remission of his sentence.

The Gujarat government had granted a remission after the May 2022 judgment in which the top court held that an application of remission should be considered in line with the policy of the state where the crime was committed. The state government then used its policy to release the convicts."

The ward councillors said the compensation assessment, undertaken by revenue officials, has overlooked thousands of affected families and businesses.

On December 23, the government had announced that 6,700 affected families from four wards of Ennore (1,4,6 and 7) who were affected by flood water as well as the oil spill will receive a compensation of Rs 7,500, in addition to Rs 6,000 promised by Chief Minister MK Stalin.

M Samuel Diraviam, councillor of ward six, alleged that revenue department officials had identified only 2,850 families as beneficiaries for compensation although around 8,000 families in his ward were affected. “The assessment should have been the responsibility of zonal level officers because they are aware of the nagars and streets that were severely affected. This is not justifiable in any way,” Samuel told The News Minute.

A resident of Raja Shanmugam Nagar in ward six, who has not been considered for the compensation, said, “We don’t know how they decided some areas were affected and others not. Along with other families, we have submitted a letter to the collector of Chennai district highlighting the inconsistencies in the assessment.”

In the neighbouring Kalaignar Nagar, some residents got compensation while their neighbours did not, alleged the resident.

Councillor Jayaram of ward four also raised similar concerns. “There are some 300 families who suffered significant losses in Jai Bhim Nagar and TF Gopal Nagar due to flood water getting mixed with the oil spill. They haven’t been considered for compensation at all. The government needs to conduct a proper re-assessment,” he said. He also raised the issue of small businesses not having been considered in these assessments.

“Fishers were definitely affected but there were other small businesses as well like tailoring units, powdering mills, etc. Why isn’t the government asking CPCL to pay for these losses as well?” he asked.

Residents are also of the view that the compensation announced doesn’t cover the losses that they have suffered. “People who work as food delivery agents have lost their two-wheelers and auto drivers have lost their vehicles. They have all spent thousands of rupees in repairing them. In addition to this, they lost furniture and household appliances. The government has, however, only given Rs 7,500, that too only to some families,” said Jayaram.

The News Minute reached out to Chennai district collector Rashmi Siddharth Zagade to understand the assessment process and how the compensatory amount was decided. However, she refused to comment on the issue.

The government had identified 2,301 families from ward one, who were primarily fishers. The compensation announced was Rs 12,500 and an additional Rs 10,000 for 787 damaged boats.

But residents of the fishing hamlets who suffered losses alleged that they didn’t receive the amount. Kuppusamy from the Nettukuppam fishing hamlet in Ennore said he is yet to receive any compensation. Whatever the government has planned to provide would not compensate for the loss that has been incurred, he said.

He asserted that a fisherman whose boat was damaged must spend at least Rs 80,000 to get a second-hand boat. “The country-made fibre boat (locally known as Naatu Padagu) costs a minimum of Rs 1.5 lakh. The higher-end fibre boats which are used for fishing by the river cost Rs 4 lakh. What kind of a change would the compensation make,” he asked.

Fishers also lost fishing nets (nool valai) that cost over Rs 1 lakh. Fishers said even cheaper fishing nets cost Rs 60,000. “The cost of 300 metre nets used in river fishing are priced between Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000,” he said. Affected fishers said they haven’t ventured into the sea since the last week of November, which has affected their livelihood."

Majumder had called Periyar “an intellectual thug who did not just marry his own adopted daughter 40 years younger, but reportedly incited local goons to sexually harass his wife to stop her from visiting a temple.”

“Nowadays it's all about personal vandalising. There is no decency in expressing news, opinions. It's all verbal violence,” the court said, according to LiveLaw.

The court said such Periyar had a stature in the society and such comments could lead to violence. “Why did you make an allegation like that? Having different ideologies is okay. One person can have a certain ideology and another can oppose it. But how can you make these allegations? If you want to criticise a person's politics, ideology, it's all okay.

Last month, three members of the collective – Radhe Krishna Ram, Ravi Gaikwad and Manaal Patil – were performing at the Press Club’s premises at Raisina Road. Halfway through the show, club president Gautam Lahiri stopped the show due to “vulgar” language.

Blue Material alleges the event was scrapped due to their caste, but the club maintained it had received complaints over the performance.

Adding to the confusion is that the club claimed they never even invited the group to perform, while Blue Material claimed this is not true.

Oddly, it was also the group’s second attempt at holding a show at PCI.

Newslaundry spoke to both parties to piece together what had happened.

The club’s version

Blue Material models itself on Def Comedy Jam, an all-Black comedy show from the 1990s. The “blue” in their name references the anti-caste movement and their style of risqué comedy.

Events at PCI are organised strictly through formal applications with the recommendation of a present member of the club and the payment of a rental charge. Otherwise, PCI can choose to host the event, in which case the rental charge is waived.

In an official statement to Newslaundry, PCI said they met with Gaikwad on December 5 and 9 to discuss the possibility of a performance. Gaikwad had allegedly approached club secretary Neeraj Thakur, giving the reference of another club member, and expressed interest in performing on the club’s premises on December 8.

Gaikwad allegedly asked that Blue Material be paid Rs 42,000 for the performance. The club said it refused, saying it could not compensate for events as a non-profit, and it would be impossible to “raise sponsorship at such short notice”.

The matter was left at that.

PCI said Gaikwad got back in touch on December 9 and asked if his group could perform on December 13. PCI claimed it asked Gaikwad to provide clippings of their previous shows and also asked him to apply formally to perform at the club.

No clippings or formal application arrived, PCI said. But on December 13, Gaikwad, Radhe and Patil allegedly turned up at the club for a performance. PCI said it allowed them to use their conference hall “in good faith” since the collective “champions the voice of the Dalits community.”

Contradictions on Dec 13

But Nitin Sethi, a PCI member and founding member of The Reporters’ Collective, told Newslaundry this wasn’t what happened at all. He said he was familiar with Blue Material and had helped them organise shows before in Delhi.

“I had recommended them along with other PCI members for the PCI to host and invite them and PCI had agreed to do so,” he said. This was corroborated by Blue Material’s Gaikwad, who said he agreed to perform for no pay, hoping the show would open the door for more gigs.

Accordingly, Blue Material arrived at the club on December 13 but “hardly anyone had shown up since no one was really aware of the show”.

“It was evident that it was not going to be a proper show. We had to invite people sitting at the club to attend the show if they were interested. At the end, 10-12 people showed up and we performed,” he said.

Sethi or the group members, however, had no written permission from the PCI to back their claims.

Sethi said, “Upon learning how the group had been mistreated, the president had then apologised with his hands folded for the wrong actions of his teammates and later requested the group to perform the next day in the open grounds as a recompense.”

Gaikwad said Lahiri “blamed what had happened on miscommunication” and promised to give the collective space the following day in PCI’s outer courtyard, complete with mics.

Lahiri said this didn’t happen at all. He alleged Sethi created a “ruckus” by accusing PCI of “sabotaging” the show, and that Sethi demanded Blue Material be allowed to perform on the open lawn the next day.

“Finally I, as the president of PCI, intervened and pacified the matter. It was verbally agreed that Blue Material would be provided the space to perform their comedy show in the lawn area,” he said.

Crucially, the comedians said they used the same supposedly “vulgar” material before ending the show that day, and received no criticism for it.

Allegations in bad faith, says PCI

So, Blue Material accordingly arrived at the club a day later. But little had changed, said Gaikwad, who also acts as the collective’s manager.

“They provided us with two Ahuja microphone systems that could barely cover 25 percent of the club’s outer courtyard,” he claimed. “We spent almost 40 minutes of our allotted time” – usually an hour and a half – “to fix the audio issue but still couldn’t. Then we decided to go ahead with what we have.”

There were perhaps 100 people sitting in the courtyard but most of them allegedly had no idea a performance was scheduled to take place.

“No one knew who was performing or the context. People were there to have drinks and we fellows were talking and throwing jokes,” said Gaikwad, who opened the performance as host. “It took me 55 minutes to set the stage for the next comedians.”

Radhe took the stage after Gaikwad. He said there was “total chaos” with “hardly 14-15 people actually watching” out of the crowd of perhaps 100.

“Nothing was proper, from sounds to lights to seating arrangements. The sound was so poor that even those in the front row were finding it difficult to hear,” he claimed. “I was also getting frustrated at the disrespect to my art. I was performing and someone was drinking and standing just in front of me, talking to others.” At one point, he told someone in the audience “we just need some silence and respect”.

As Radhe continued his performance, cracking a joke on masturbation, he alleged that club president Lahiri approached him and “snatched the mic”. Lahiri was accompanied by a “few others”.

“He told us to stop the show. He said they received complaints that we were talking about masturbation,” claimed Ravi. “But there’s never a ruckus because of a single joke. The ruckus is created based on the whole show and a joke is only used as a trigger point to blow it out of proportion.”

Which is why Gaikwad believes the event was scrapped “because of their caste and blue comedy”.

Sethi concurred. He said, “I found the behaviour and the tone of some of the PCI officials laced with undertones of casteism and disrespect which the PCI would never show to other guests it regularly invites and hosts.”

PCI termed the allegations against the club of being casteist as being made in “bad faith.” In an official statement, the club maintained the trigger for stopping the show was the “use of extremely vulgar language which caused a lot of discomfiture among some of the women members”.

“They complained to me, which I was obligated to address. The liberal use of vulgar words such as ‘masturbation’, ‘chudai’, ‘fucking’, etc, were specifically mentioned by the complainants,” the statement said.

“Had PCI been given the clips of Blue Material’s previous shows, as requested on two occasions, the club would have made alternative arrangements without inconveniencing or causing discomfort to those not interested in listening,” it added.

But Sethi told Newslaundry: “If the PCI management claims after talking for weeks with the Blue Material group, it wasn’t even aware of what the group does, and yet, twice badly organised and hosted their event in the club, then they are admitting to additional incompetence which I have little to compliment them about it.”

He added: “To me, the vulgarity was just an excuse that was used to deny Dalit artists space in the name of protecting the dignity of women by some men.”

A journalist who had been present during the failed show on December 13 told Newslaundry she would not characterise the jokes as “vulgar”.

“The language was ok, very Gen Z language. They might have used cuss words a lot here and there. But when they started the performance, it was clear what they were going to talk about,” she said. “...I can understand somebody might not have liked the language. Because people cannot associate these issues to be mixed with sex jokes or certain use of certain words. But overall it was fine. I might criticise them for their comedy but not their choice of words.”

Surabhi Kanga, a board member at the Press Club and web editor at The Caravan, said: “I was present in the audience during the performance. I had no issues with the comedy myself – I found it pretty edgy, funny and subversive. Comedy is a great way to have some tough conversations, both around sex and around caste. I felt the comedians were doing this quite well.”"

But the email address it mentioned was incorrect.

The notice by the high-level committee, led by former president Ram Nath Kovind, sought suggestions to make “appropriate changes in the existing legal administrative framework to enable simultaneous elections in the country.” It was published on January 5 in major newspapers such as Hindustan Times and Dainik Jagran.

Emails sent to sc-hlc@gov.in by Newslaundry bounced back with an automated message that said, “Address not found. Your message wasn't delivered to s c-hlc@gov.in because the address couldnt be found or is unable to receive email.”

The correct email address, se-hlc@gov.in, can be found on One Nation, One Election’s website, at the bottom of the page and on the ‘contact us’ section of the website.

Newslaundry has emailed the committee on its correct email address, asking if they were aware of the error, if they are rectifying it in any way, and why only 10 days were given for the public to make suggestions. This copy will be updated once a response is received.

The notice said that the committee was required to make recommendations for creation of an appropriate legal and administrative framework for holding simultaneous elections on a permanent basis, identification of necessary amendments to the Constitution and related election laws, preparation of common electoral rolls, logistics such as EVMs/VVPATs, etc.

Meanwhile, CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote to the committee on Monday, calling the One Nation, One Election plan “inherently anti-democratic” and saying that it “negates” fundamental principles of federalism. The CPI (M) leader also said the “agenda and purpose” of the committee was “pre-decided and predestined”.



High-level committee

One Nation, One Election has been a prominent poll promise of the BJP since 2014.

Ever since the committee was constituted by the Centre on September 2, 2022, it has held two meetings and invited suggestions from political parties.

The committee also includes Home Minister Amit Shah, former Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, former Lok Sabha secretary general Subhash C Kashyap, Harish Salve, 15th Finance Commission chairperson N K Singh, and former chief vigilance commissioner Sanjay Kothari. Congress Lok Sabha MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury was included in the committee, but resigned soon after its formation.

Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal is a special invitee who can attend meetings, while Law Secretary Nitin Chandra is set to be the secretary to the panel.

Elections to Lok Sabha and all state assemblies were held simultaneously every five years from 1951 and 1967. The process was discontinued soon after, after states were reorganised, new states were formed, and legislative assemblies were dissolved.

The Election Commission’s annual report in 1983 suggested reverting back to simultaneous elections. The Law Commission report also referred to this in 1999.

In 2015, the Parliamentary Standing Committee’s 79th Report recommended simultaneous elections for Parliament and state assemblies. The ECI also backed the idea in 2015, as did the Law Commission of India in 2018."

The results were predictable, and indeed, had been widely predicted. “When Bangladesh goes to the polls on January 7,” Oslo-based Bangladeshi academic and author Mubashar Hasan wrote in a piece for 360info.org published three days before the polls, “the great performance of democracy will take centre stage. Voting booths will be set up, voters will cast votes, and they will be counted. However, despite the show, there is no surprise twist lurking for election watchers, because the result is already known. Sheikh Hasina will be re-elected for a fifth time, and her party, the Bangladesh Awami League (AL), will form government once again.”

The decision of the main opposition party, the Bangladesh National Party, and 11 other parties with which it had formed an alliance, to boycott the elections, had made the results a foregone conclusion. The opposition alliance also called for a public curfew on voting day. Their call had an impact; the voting percentage was around 40 percent, down from more than 80 percent in the last general elections held in December 2018.

The opposition had been demanding that elections be held under a neutral caretaker government because they did not expect free and fair polls under Awami League rule. This followed widespread allegations of rigging and ballot-box stuffing in the 2018 elections, in which Hasina’s party along with its allies won 288 of 298 seats for which polling was held. The Awami League by itself, minus allies, secured 77 per cent of the vote. This was coincidentally also the percentage secured by Vladimir Putin, who won the Russian presidential elections the same year with 77 percent of the vote.

Setback to democratic politics?

Hasina’s victory will be warmly welcomed by Russia, China and India, but is likely to be seen as a setback to democratic politics by the US and Western countries where concern about her increasingly autocratic rule has been mounting for several years. Her long-time rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, 78, was barred from electoral politics after being convicted of corruption in 2018 and sentenced to 17 years in jail. She is now chronically ill and in what effectively amounts to house arrest, although the use of that term is disputed by the Bangladesh government.

Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, the acting Chairman of the BNP, is in exile in the UK. He told The Diplomat in an interview that “over 138,500 politically motivated cases have been launched against 5 million members of BNP and other democratic parties”. The BNP held a grand rally on October 28. After that, over 22,000 opposition leaders and activists were arrested, Rahman said in mid-December.

Despite the obvious crackdown on opposition parties, the elections saw the participation of 1,895 candidates from 26 parties for the 300 seats. The main party in the fray, apart from the ruling Awami League, was its erstwhile ally, the Jatiya Party founded by former military dictator late HM Ershad, which contested 289 seats, and won a paltry 11. The party’s current chairman GM Qader, who was one of the 11 winning candidates, had predicted in July that only the Awami League could win if elections were held while Hasina remained PM, and that “nothing will change, everything will be the same, everything will be managed”.

The hope that everything will be the same is precisely what drove India’s support for Sheikh Hasina.

Behind India’s support

Before she came to power in polls held in December 2008, Bangladesh under Hasina’s predecessor Khaleda Zia had become a safe sanctuary for multiple militant groups from Northeast India. The top ULFA leadership was based there; the leader of the principal valley-based insurgent group from Manipur, the UNLF, was there; the powerful Naga insurgent group, the NSCN(IM) was a part of arms trafficking networks there; other smaller groups from across the region had training camps for militants in there. After she took charge, Hasina moved quickly to dismantle those camps and had the leaders of the militant groups picked up and handed over informally to Indian authorities.

She also led a crackdown on the rising Islamist extremism in the country. Soon after coming to power, her government established an International Crimes Tribunal to prosecute those who were involved in the Bangladesh genocide of 1971, in which, according to varying estimates, between at least a million and three million people died. The top leadership of the largest right-wing Islamist party in the country, the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, was arrested, with several of its leaders receiving death sentences.

The Jamaat had collaborated with Pakistan in the 1971 war that split the country. What is now Bangladesh was then East Pakistan.

Some leading lights of the BNP were also found guilty of war crimes in those trials. One of them, Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury, a shipping magnate from Chittagong and a BNP Member of Parliament, was sentenced to death and hanged in 2015. More than a decade earlier, in 2004, he had been implicated in a separate crime – a massive arms smuggling attempt through Chittagong port that included 2,000 automatic and semi-automatic rifles, 25,000 grenades and 1.8 million rounds of ammunition bound for militant groups in Northeast India.

It is therefore not surprising that the Indian establishment, both during the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government and subsequently under the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, has been wary of the BNP and its allies such as the Jamaat returning to power in Dhaka.

India’s longest land border of 4,096 km is with Bangladesh. That nearly half of it is with states of Northeast India makes it all the more crucial, from an Indian national security perspective, that hostile forces not be able to operate freely from Bangladesh.

Washington, Delhi on opposite sides

The US understands this concern, but the US and India have historically been on opposite sides in Bangladesh.

Back in 1971, the US government of Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger actively aided the genocidal regime of Pakistani dictator Yahya Khan and even sent an aircraft carrier group led by the USS Enterprise to the Bay of Bengal to threaten India once it entered the war on the side of the East Bengali freedom fighters. It was then the Soviet Union which had backed India against America.

Russia remains an important ally for both India and Bangladesh. It is constructing Bangladesh’s first nuclear power plant which is scheduled for commissioning this year. Bangladesh has also developed close ties with China, especially in the sphere of defence. The two countries have a Defence Cooperation Agreement.

Bangladesh is the second-largest recipient of Chinese weapons in the world, after Pakistan, and has bought submarines, warships, tanks, missiles and other military equipment from that country.

It is a poor country with a population roughly twice the size of Germany’s, an economy that has run into trouble after a burst of rapid growth, and growing geopolitical tensions with Western countries that are its major trade partners. The US is its largest export market.

Rise in tensions likely

Internal political and social tensions can only be expected to grow after elections that did not see the participation of the principal opposition. Hasina’s perceived closeness to India is also increasingly unpopular in Bangladesh. Events such as the scheduled inauguration of the grand Ram Mandir in Ayodhya by the Indian Prime Minister make news there as well, adding to existing communal tensions.

At a broader geopolitical level, ties between India and countries such as the US and Canada have seen tensions of late due to alleged assassinations and assassination attempts on Khalistan proponents there. India’s position in Bangladesh undoubtedly adds to the friction points.

China is competing with India for influence in its immediate neighbourhood, in countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. As India pursues its multi-aligned foreign policy, it may find itself increasingly isolated, fending off China on its own."

The US-headquartered Foreign Press Association, which represents at least 370 journalists from about 130 media outlets, had asked the Israeli court last month to allow journalists to enter Gaza.

At present, foreign correspondents can enter the Palestinian territory “embedded” with or accompanied by Israeli troops. The media body called it “limited access,” saying that the arrangement restricted access to areas where the Israeli forces were not present, Reuters reported .

Rejecting the media association’s plea, the Israel Supreme Court said it recognises the right of freedom of the press, but the current wartime circumstances justified the curbs, TRT reported . The court upheld that the current system allowing the media to “embed” with the forces was a “balanced and reasonable policy”.

It said that journalists inside Gaza could put Israeli forces at risk by reporting about the troop positions.

A total of more than 23,000 people have been killed in the war between Palestinian militants Hamas and Israeli forces since October 7 – with more than 22,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza and the West Bank, and over 1,200 deaths in Israel."

Sitting on the unlevelled mud floor of her semi-broken home, kitchenware and clothing strewn all around her, Manju Modanwal glumly says the Ram temple’s construction is a “good thing”.

“Sabse badi samasya samapt hogayi, aur ka?” she says in Awadhi, her expression deadpan. (The biggest problem is over, what else is there?)

The temple will finally free Ayodhya from the grip of the mandir-masjid conflict. Residents will no longer have to bear the cost of communal tensions, curfews, and constant police bandobast. Manju, hailing from the Halwai community, hopes her children, at least, will have a better future, both economically and socially, even as she struggles to sustain her family in the remnants of the house-cum-shop located at Ram Path.

When the temple’s construction got underway, she did not anticipate the sacrifices her family and others in the town would be forced to make. In April, the front portion of their home, where they run a chaat bhandaar, was demolished as part of a road-widening project. Over 4,000 residential and commercial structures, including several ancient temples and mosques, were razed to widen the 13-km road, which connects Shahadatganj in Faizabad to Naya Ghat, by 20 metres.

“This is the first time we are seeing any kind of development,” says Manju’s college-going daughter Rani. “All these years, no government did anything for this town. Everything new you see around has been developed in the last two years.”

The decades of legal and communal conflict over the right to construct the temple left Ayodhya woefully underdeveloped in terms of basic infrastructure and public amenities. Large parts of the town are dotted with narrow lanes, crumbling courtyards, ancient temples, mosques and minarets, and brick and sand houses, like a time frozen in a dusty frame.

The three-km precinct surrounding Hanumangarhi and the Ram Janmabhoomi temple is filled with temples, tiny shops, and hawkers selling puja paraphernalia, garlands, plastic toys, jewellery, and spiritual books. There are no big, fancy shops or restaurants. Visitors who mostly arrive on day trips are dependent on corner shops for snacks and chai, and dhabas for meals.

Which is why Rani is excited about the rapid pace of development, bringing the frills of a modern city to the tranquil temple town: a new airport, wifi zones, a Ramayana theme park, and recreational activities at the ghats.

“From one perspective, all this change is good,” says Rani, “and from another, it is also destructive.”

The Modanwal family received compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh, but it wasn’t enough to cover the cost of a new floor or wall plaster, leaving the house decrepit.

Small shopkeepers and businesses have paid a heavy price for the road expansion projects, says Nandu Kumar Gupta, president of the Ayodhya Udyog Vyapar Mandal trade union. “It should have been planned keeping in mind the interests and welfare of the native population. Instead, we have been harassed and threatened and paid a penury in compensation.”"

All of this is us, hyperbole-hungry Indians, fattening ourselves on one or the other discourse.

One: the shock of what happened to Bilkis Bano in 2002 – the gangrape of her, her mother and her cousin; the murder of her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter and 12 of her family members before her eyes; her struggle for justice past corrupt policemen, courts and doctors, past a botched-up investigation; and finally, the conviction of the 11 men. Only to have them released on India’s 75th Independence Day on August 15, 2022. And now, finally, the convicts have been sent back to jail at the behest of many petitions in the Supreme Court by her and citizens’ groups.

The other narrative: the victory discourse in which a brave woman stood against all odds, in which many citizen groups, lawyers, and people who cannot be named helped her move home and hide from murderers 12 times, until finally, the good side won.

Both of these stories sound like pantomimes of each other, in which there is very little room for you and I, for normal people, to figure out what to do with this and how to process it. As a recent migrant from the big, anonymising city of Delhi to small town Shamli in western Uttar Pradesh, I have new eyes – given to me by my colleagues at the grassroot organisation we have set up to work against gender, caste, and religious violence. These are Buddha eyes, or the ability to look past either extreme and stay in the middle. That is the only vision I have, even as I signed on as one of the petitioners in the Bilkis case that won in court on January 8, 2024.

From a median position, it’s possible to see how the right-wing and the governing BJP will use everything in their power to push their position. They have hung on for the longest time, to the coat-tails of another famous Muslim woman to do it. Shah Bano. Remember her? The Muslim woman from Madhya Pradesh divorced her husband in 1978 and applied to the Supreme Court of India for maintenance. She was granted the right to alimony.

But fearing a backlash from Muslims, the Congress party, with a brute majority, passed a new law in 1986, which mandated that Muslim women had to adhere to Islamic law to avail of the right to alimony. This landmark case was a blot on India’s secular history, and Shah Bano became the thorn in the Congress’s side that the BJP could use forever to show the people of India that the Congress only built vote banks – it appeased Muslims and didn’t care about the rights of women.

It took a very long time from that verdict in 1986 for the BJP to harvest the Shah Bano idea into a full-fledged political reversal in 2014 – with, of course, one period of government as the NDA coalition under Atal Bihari Vajpayee in between. So, it’s interesting to see how another Muslim woman will turn the tide of Indian history yet again. But to really see what this means, we have to centre ourselves and look past her, look past the case, and look at the long durée of the politics of our times. Be zen about it and wait. And then, like a slow drip filter coffee, we will be able to taste the notes of caffeine, find that there is no chicory, and be able to smell and see.

In mid-sight, between victory and terror, is the cold calculus of time and politics in its mundane and everyday form. We mostly inhabit this space made up of everyday decisions. The banality of evil must be countered by the banality of the un-evil in day-to-day life. In moments such as these, shall we go to the dinner party where a former rapist is now being feted, or shall we stay away? Now, in the scepticism of this question to ourselves is the word Bilkis. Will our action enable another Bilkis to be treated as a rape trophy and her rapists celebrated? In other words, are we helping keep the system from fixing itself? Bilkis the answer the next time.

When we have to decide if we’re impressed with a strident political speech or a movie that valorises an animal instinct, we can Bilkis ourselves and figure out how to be, what to do, what to watch, participate in, and what to stay away from.

At the same time, we must also ask ourselves why our country performs these grotesque masterpieces of hate over and over again. And how can we stop being the consumers of and audience for the hate with which the three-and-a-half-year-old’s skull was smashed on a rock, mother raped, grandmother raped, and then re-purposed for India’s 75th day Independence celebration as we, the people, stood by dazed and confused. We did not protest; we stood and stared.

We must not stop and think that everything will change at once. In a cellular way, like the Shah Bano case, which tore away the lies and pretence of the Congress government but still took a few decades to properly shred, this megapolis of hate will take a long time to dismember. But like Shah Bano allowed a foot in the door to the BJP, Bilkis will forever be that word for the new Congress in saffron clothing.

In other words, it is up to us, the public, to take power back, to realise our potential as people, and to use the sheer power we have to never forget. To think of our 75th Independence Day as the blackest, foulest day in our independent history. To write it and describe it properly as the death of our democracy and yesterday’s verdict as a small chink of light that should remind us of the darkness that engulfs us and the need to keep shining the light, derived from Bilkis. If she has to be a word, a part of history, a cataclysm, then let us make it this one: light.

This is the second such action against the TV news outlet within a period of five months. The I&B ministry had imposed a 72-hour ban on the channel on September 22 last year after it aired a “sexually explicit” video allegedly featuring BJP leader Kirit Somaiya.

Lokshahi Marathi editor-in-chief Kamlesh Sutar told Newslaundry that the news channel has been operational for about four years, since January 2020, but the ministry had “started picking out problems” with it over the last five months.

He claimed that the media outlet had begun broadcasting “only after acquiring all the permissions and with the required documentation”. But the ministry had cited “incomplete documentation” and “errors"" for the 30-day broadcasting ban.

Sutar said the January 9 ban order had come as a “shock”, and that the company had been asked to “complete the required paperwork” within 30 days.

Newslaundry looked at the copy of the order issued by I&B ministry under secretary Hamsa Ravishankar to Zora Traders, which owns Lokshahi Marathi.

The order said the media outlet had been sourcing its content from a third party, Swaraj Marathi Broadcasting LLP, without prior approval by the ministry.

The order said it was a violation of the ministry’s “essential condition of permission”.

It said while Zora Traders had been granted permission to operate Lokshahi Marathi news channel, it was only allowed to generate its own content for news and current affairs.

The I&B ministry also stated that Zora Traders did not have the “basic infrastructure” or studio to create its content, and it also did not “incur any expenditure on manpower” to create content. “The entire process of content creation, generation is done by M/s Swaraj Marathi Broadcasting LLP which is not a permitted entity,” the order stated.

A submission filed by Zora Traders, seen by Newslaundry, stated that Swaraj Marathi Broadcasting LLP and Zora Traders were owned by Bahubali Shantilal Shah and were sister firms, and it would bring all its media operations under the latter.

Sutar, meanwhile, pointed to “targeted action” by the ministry. He said, “Over the past four months, the ministry has suddenly demanded documentation related to the organisation, which we have been providing on a timely basis.”

He said the company responded to the first show-cause notice issued on November 17, 2023, and also appeared before the ministry on December 14, 2023, to “request more time to make necessary arrangements” and bring the “entire activity of the channel” under Zora Traders “as required by the ministry”.

Meanwhile, Mumbai Press Club demanded that Lokshahi Marathi be allowed to resume broadcasting. In a statement issued on January 10, it said that “these technical objections were nothing but a fig leaf for finding fault to shut down the channel”, and the 30-day suspension could be a “death knell”.

The statement said: “These technical objections are nothing but a fig leaf for finding fault to shut down the channel as a counterattack for having shown a politician from a ruling party in a poor light. Without commenting on the journalistic ethics on whether the sex life of politicians should be exposed or not, the Press Club finds it strange that there should be crocodile tears for a politician who, day in and day out, is involved in highlighting the wrongdoings of rival politicians and social figures.”

The press body further said that the order of suspension revealed that Lokshahi Marathi’s submissions in its defence were “hardly considered” and instead had been “summarily dismissed”.

“In today’s age of high competition among news channels, a suspension order of 30 days can be the death knell of a TV channel. In the interests of free speech, the Mumbai Press Club demands that the suspension order against Lokshahi Marathi be immediately withdrawn and the channel be allowed to resume operations,” said the statement.

A Kirit Somaiya link?

Sutar said the 72-hour broadcast ban imposed in September last year, in the wake of the Kirit Somaiya video controversy, was revoked by the Delhi High Court. “It is important to note that we had filed a case against the ban and the high court had ruled in our favour within 24 hours.”

He said that although the “reason for the broadcast ban was different this time”, they would “again fight the case legally”. He said the company would move court against the ministry’s action.

“We are confident that we will get justice from the court this time as well,” said Sutar, adding that Lokshahi Marathi will continue its “fearless journalism” through its YouTube channel.

The Mumbai-based channel has been in constant trouble since its video report on the “sexually explicit” clips, allegedly of BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, was aired on July 17 last year.

The channel had reportedly intended to raise questions of “privacy concerns” while broadcasting the clips. During the show, Sutar said that “if the privacy of such a big leader can be compromised using technology, then the privacy of common citizens is also in danger.”

He repeatedly said on the show that his “intent was not to defame”, but that the channel wanted to highlight that a leader “fighting against corruption” was being targeted.

The video had triggered a political storm in Maharashtra, with the police initiating an inquiry into the matter a day later.

Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also ordered a police probe into the issue after leader of opposition Ambadas Danve submitted a pen drive with Somaiya’s alleged video clips to the chair of Maharashtra legislative council Neelam Gorhe. Fadnavis had said that a detailed investigation would be conducted and “no one would be spared”.

Following the probe orders, a team of Mumbai crime branch police raided Lokshahi Marathi’s Mumbai office in Anderi East locality and seized the video footage. They also demanded that the channel reveal its source. However, the channel refused to reveal the identity of its source.

On August 10, Somaiya sent a legal notice to Lokshahi and its editor-in-chief Sutar alleging breach of privacy.

Following the notice, four BJP MLAs from Mumbai submitted complaints against Lokshahi Marathi to I&B minister Anurag Thakur and TRAI chairman PD Vaghela. While MLAs Yogesh Sagar and Parag Shah sent their complaints to Thakur, MLAs Mihir Kotecha and Ram Kadam filed it with Vaghela. A total of four complaints were filed between August 5 and 14.

In response to the complaints, the I&B ministry served a notice to Zora Traders stating that the video story on Somaiya was in violation of the Cable Television Network (Regulation) Act, 1995. It demanded a reply from the company within a week.

The notice sent by I&B ministry deputy director Prateek Jain stated that during the show, the anchor cited some politicians to portray that Somaiya had misused his connections in government agencies, such as the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI, to abuse women.

It said the anchor tried to tarnish the image of Somaiya, and also did not reach out to him for his statement. An FIR was lodged at Mumbai’s cyber police station against Sutar on September 5. He was booked under charges of defamation and violation of the IT Act.

On September 22, Lokshahi Marathi was served the 72-hour ban notice by the I&B ministry. The channel’s broadcast remained suspended for the next 24 hours and only began after it was granted relief by Delhi High Court on September 23.

Sutar said, “We are here to do journalism and not to take sides of any political party. As a journalist, it's our job to ask questions to the government in power, irrespective of which party it belongs to, and we will continue to do so.”

Newslaundry reached out to the office of I&B ministry under secretary Hamsa Ravishankar with queries on the matter. This report will be updated on receiving their response."

It is a precursor to what we can expect in the rest of this year.

On January 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Lakshadweep, a group of 36 islands in the Arabian Sea which is a Union territory. It is not clear what was the provocation for this visit. There are no elections on the immediate horizon. Then why?

In a carefully curated video and photographs that were released to the media and circulated through social media, Modi is seen, alone, on a sparkling white beach. He walks, sits, gazes out at the sea, all this with several changes of clothes. And then, wearing a bodysuit used for deep sea diving, he is seen snorkelling, accompanied by two divers. This is the only image where we see someone else.

The message in this promo, by none other than the prime minister, is that Indians should choose the beautiful beaches of the island territory for holidays and tourism.

What followed, of course, was more than just a rush of Indians to the Lakshadweep. The resultant ultra-nationalism, with celebrities and influencers making vapid statements about how Lakshadweep was better than the Maldives, another group of islands in the Arabian Sea with beautiful beaches and coral reefs, exposed the real intent behind the promotion.

India has been uneasy ever since Mohammed Muizzu was elected president of the island state in November last year. He has openly reached out to China and already signed 20 agreements as part of a bilateral Comprehensive Strategic Cooperative Partnership.

The economy of the Maldives is heavily dependent on tourism and Indian tourists constitute a substantial percentage. It appears that the “boycott Maldives” trend triggered by the Modi visit was not spontaneous. It has resulted in hyper-nationalism in India and sharp critical statements by ministers in Muizzu’s cabinet in response.

Apart from the strategic dimensions of this silly spat, the incident has underlined a couple of factors that are perhaps an indication of the way all media will be used in the future. One, that those with the skill to use social media can push agendas if mainstream media picks up the cue and follows the lead. The BJP has already shown its mastery in this regard. And second, that leading up to 2024, this is the kind of strategy that will be used increasingly to build up the image of Narendra Modi.

In the social media melee that followed the tourism promo, no one mentioned the environmental challenges that the Maldives already faces because of tourism. Troubled as it is with the prospect of sea level rise due to global warming, the island state has seen beaches disappear and its precious coral reefs being bleached due to the pollution caused by human intervention.

The Lakshadweep is safe for the moment because the tourist trade has not expanded. But after this little exercise, if it does – and there are already indications that the trend has begun – we will see an end to those pristine beaches and the coral reefs that have survived.

While these environmental aspects of opening Lakshadweep to tourism were barely discussed in the media, another major story that concerns the destruction of pristine natural forests has also got hardly any traction in mainstream media.

The Hasdeo Arand Forest in Chhattisgarh, described as “one of the last unfragmented forest landscapes in Central India”, will be decimated if expansion of the existing coal mines is permitted. Despite reports by two credible organisations, the Wildlife Institute of India and the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education advising against expansion, the union government gave its clearance in 2022.

The decision has been met with vociferous opposition by the local Adivasi population. They have taken out massive rallies in the state capital Raipur. Yet, barring a passing news item or a small single column photograph, these protests have barely been covered. The mines, incidentally, are owned by Adani group.

According to an investigative story in Scroll.in a year ago, the second phase of the mining project, which envisages an expansion of the existing two mines in the Hasdeo Arand Forest, would result in 2.5 lakh trees being cut in an area of 1,137 hectares. The forest, spread over 1,500 sq km, is one of the few remaining untouched forests in central India. It hosts rare plants and several species of endangered animals.

But, as I have argued in earlier columns, saving the environment has become a passing concern in mainstream media. And governments, both state and central, are champions at churning out politically correct rhetoric even as their actions are leading to environmental devastation.

To end on a more positive note, the only bit of good news as we enter the new year has been the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Bilkis Bano case . It has ordered that the 11 men sentenced for life for murder and rape during the Gujarat violence of 2002, who were granted remission of their jail term by the Gujarat government, be sent back to prison. It has concluded that the remission order by the Gujarat government was fraudulent. This ruling has generated some optimism that perhaps justice is still possible.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has also taken note of a petition filed by a journalist about the way caste operates inside prisons and the casteist nature of prison manuals that are still being used in Indian jails in 2024.

This shocking revelation was made in 2020 by an excellent series of five articles in the Wire by Sukanya Shantha and Jahnavi Sen titled “Barred: the prison project”. They studied prison manuals in different states and spoke to prisoners belonging to the marginalised castes, especially Dalits.

What they found was perhaps not unusual given that caste continues to determine how Indian society is run. But the series revealed that official prison manuals laid down tasks that prisoners are expected to do while serving their sentences on caste lines. Thus, only upper castes are assigned cooking duties while Dalits have no choice but to clean. These manuals from colonial times have never been revised.

This quote sums it up:

“Caste-based labour, in fact, is sanctioned in the prison manuals of many states. The colonial texts of the late 19th century have barely seen any amendments, and caste-based labour remains an untouched part of these manuals. While every state has its own unique prison manual, they are mostly based on The Prisons Act, 1894. These jail manuals mention every activity in detail – from the measurement of food and space per prisoner to punishments for the ‘disorderly ones’.”

The expose was noted and appreciated when it appeared, and the journalists won awards. But the issue would have remained unaddressed had it not been for the decision of one of them, Sukanya Shantha, to follow up by going to court.

The hearings in the case have just begun in the Supreme Court. As prisons are under state governments, it has asked 11 states to look at their prison manuals. This could lead to important and long-term change.

The lesson to draw from this is that sometimes journalists cannot rest after they have done a path-breaking investigative story. In a society, and particularly today when both politics and mainstream media seem determined to distract rather than inform, there is little choice before journalists but to follow up on the information unearthed and find ways to make the change happen. This is what Sukanya Shantha from the Wire has done by filing her case."

Following the gas leak on the night of December 26, at least 44 people were admitted to Akash Hospital, a private hospital located almost six kilometres away from Periyakuppam – the fishing hamlet most affected due to its proximity to CIL.

Several residents of Periyakuppam have alleged that the doctors at the hospital hurriedly discharged them on December 30, although they were still suffering from the ill-effects of the leak.

The News Minute spoke to Desarani, a resident of Periyakuppam, who said she is yet to recover from the disaster. “Around 11.40 pm on December 26, I suddenly found myself unable to breathe. My sons took me to the hospital on a two-wheeler, but I fainted as soon as I stepped out of the house,” she recalled.

Desarani was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and three days later, the doctors declared that she was fine and she could be discharged. “But I was still struggling to breathe, and when I requested them to extend my hospitalisation, they refused to do so. Upon returning home, I started vomiting and fainted again, so I was rushed back to the hospital,” she said, still gasping for air between words.

“What was the hurry? Was the hospital under pressure to discharge us to show that the effects of the leak were minimal? This makes us wonder if the government and the authorities are choosing the company over so many of our lives,” she said.

Kumar, an Oor Nirvagi or administrator of a traditional, non-governmental welfare body of the Periyakuppam village, alleged that besides Desarani, three other people who were above the age of 60 were discharged from the hospital within two to three days, despite not having fully-recovered. “They were forced to go to other hospitals, such as the Government Stanley Hospital, for further treatment because of this,” he said.

But at other hospitals, they were required to produce their medical reports from the night of the gas leak, which Akash Hospital allegedly continues to withhold.

Celcha, another gas leak victim from Periyakuppam who was discontent with her hasty discharge, said Akash Hospital still has not handed over her scans and X-rays.

“They only gave me the prescription and withheld my chest scan and X-ray. I asked them once, but they did not give me the scans then. Later, as I was still finding it difficult to breathe and we wanted to approach another doctor for a second opinion, my husband went back to Akash Hospital to collect them. They told my husband they will give the reports in three days, but it has been ten days since,” she added.

The News Minute spoke to almost 10 people who were hospitalised, and all of them shared similar experiences. “Our livelihood has taken a hit since the cyclone in December. There was the CPCL oil spill and then the gas leak, and we have not ventured into the sea ever since. We have had no income at all for 40 days now. The private hospitals nearby will charge us for new scans and X-rays, for which we have no money. So we have to travel long distances to take treatment from government hospitals,” Desarani said.

Kumar had visited the Akash Hospital, asking them to hand over the medical reports of the 39 people who were admitted to the hospital from his village. “They said that they need time to go through them and study them. We do not understand what they are studying after claiming that the patients are treated and safe to go home. We are afraid they are hiding something,” he said.

The News Minute reached out to Akash Hospital, but didn’t receive any response.

It was around 11.45 pm on December 26 that the pressure in the pipelines carrying ammonia gas from the ships to the sea-bed dropped, resulting in the gas leakage.

However, the Periyakuppam residents were only alerted about it by word-of-mouth, by workers returning from their late night shifts, after which they started evacuating their homes.

Several people who spoke to The News Minute alleged that the company did not use the emergency alarm button to alert residents or help them evacuate to safety. The residents of the area have since been protesting against the CIL, demanding that its Ennore plant be permanently shut."

The case was filed in 2002 after a report in Tehelka accused the complainant, retired Major General MS Ahluwalia, of corruption in import deals of defence equipment in 2001. The high court bench of Justice Neena Bansal Krishna in July 2023 had held Tejpal, Bahal, and journalist Mathew Samuel guilty. However, the journalists’ counsel moved an appeal against the order, arguing that they did not have the means to pay such a huge amount in damages.

On Friday, Tejpal and Bahal told the division bench of Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Pritam Singh Arora that they will “make it clear that Ahluwalia neither asked for nor accepted any bribe”.

The court then asked the two to publish the apology in Hindustan Times within two weeks, and also deposit Rs 10 lakh each with the court.

Ahluwalia's counsel had argued that the officer had lived with “stigma” for nearly 22 years and a mere apology was not enough. However, the bench said that in such defamation matters, apology was the major relief."

But the Congress itself seems torn asunder, especially with state units in northern India not wanting to entirely boycott an event that holds such emotional currency.

In Himachal Pradesh, Congress minister Vikramaditya Singh announced he’d attend the ceremony anyway “out of respect for my late father”, former CM Vidarbha Singh who had supported the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The state’s current CM, Sukhvinder Singh, said he hadn’t been invited for the ceremony but “whether we get an invitation or not, Lord Ram is the centre of our aastha”.

In Gujarat, senior Congressman Arjun Modhwadia said the party “should have stayed away from taking such political decisions”. Ambarish Der, working president of the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee, said the Congress’s statement was “disappointing” and advised the party to “respect public sentiment”

In Uttar Pradesh, Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam said the “suicidal” decision had “broken the hearts of many party workers”. The state Congress already announced that hundreds of its workers would descend upon Ayodhya on January 15 to pray at the makeshift temple.

Among others, Kashmiri leader Karan Singh said that since the Supreme Court had permitted the temple’s construction, there should be no hesitation in attending the ceremony. And in Karnataka, where Chief Minister Siddaramaiah supported the high command’s decision, saying it was a “political propaganda campaign”, his deputy CM, DK Shivakumar, asked , “What’s wrong in attending the consecration ceremony?”

There’s plenty wrong. The contentious history of the mandir – built on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid – is conspicuously absent from discussion. This is true of the endless media reportage on the consecration, and its various associated inaugurations, resulting in a whitewashing of history on a daily basis.

And let’s be clear, to not attend the inauguration is a hard decision – and the right one. But the Congress’s positions on the issue have historically lacked conviction or clarity.

A series of unfortunate events

Appeals to build a temple in Ayodhya were made as far back as the 1880s . But it was on the night of December 22-23, 1949 that a Ram idol “appeared” under the central dome of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.

Four days later, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru would send a telegram to Uttar Pradesh CM Govind Ballabh Pant: “Earnestly hope you will personally interest yourself in this matter. Dangerous example being set there which will have bad consequences.”

Of course, the “appearance” of the idol was an elaborate conspiracy passed off as a divine miracle . But it set the tone for the decades to follow. The land became “disputed” and the deity itself became a litigant in the court battle in 1989.

And it was Rajiv Gandhi who played a key role in reviving the issue.

In April 1978, a woman named Shah Bano filed a petition at an Indore court asking that her divorced husband pay maintenance. Her husband contested that he, as per Muslim personal law, only had to pay maintenance for the iddat period of three months, which had ended. But the local court, high court and Supreme Court all weighed in Bano’s favour.

Tensions ran high. The Muslim clergy was outraged. Protests broke out. Shah Bano’s son said Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi allegedly summoned his mother to Delhi, where he “asked us to refuse the maintenance”.

As the story goes, Rajiv Gandhi took a decision that he hoped would appease the angered Muslims. His government began discussions over the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce) Act. It effectively circumvented the SC verdict by stating that maintenance needed to be paid for the iddat period alone.

In the process, he annoyed everyone else – progressive Muslims, women and Hindus who didn’t approve of “appeasement politics”. Defenders of the Congress will say Gandhi either had no other choice, or that he was “betrayed” into passing the bill.

But having cheered up one community with an unwise decision, he then fell to the task of cheering up the other with one more. In Faizabad, a petition was filed seeking public access into the Babri Masjid, where the Ram idol still remained. The gate had reportedly been locked by Gandhi’s grandfather in 1949 after said idol’s “appearance”.

On February 1, 1986, the main gate of the Babri Masjid was unlocked. Commentators would later say Rajiv had no idea this had happened though this is debatable. In his book India After Gandhi, historian Ramachandra Guha said the judge’s order “was widely believed to have been directed from Delhi, from the Prime Minister’s Office, no less”.

Unlocking the gate telegraphed the legitimacy of Hindu claims to the mosque. Ayodhya became the fledgling BJP’s chief campaign issue. To counter it, Rajiv in November 1989 permitted the Vishva Hindu Parishad to lay the foundation stone for a new Ram temple near the mosque. He also spoke of “Ram Rajya” in a campaign speech. It opened the floodgates to the demolition of the mosque three years later.

Congress leaders today play up the devastating truth of Rajiv’s role, hoping to steal some of the Ram temple valour from the BJP. In the words of Madhav Godbole , who quit as union home secretary after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Rajiv was “the second most prominent kar sevak”.

Why the Congress is exactly the same

The rest is history.

In December 1992, when the mosque was brought down, PV Narasimha Rao was prime minister. Godbole said Rao “played the most important role in this crucial test match, but, unfortunately, he turned out to be a non-playing captain”. More damningly, journalist Kuldip Nayar later wrote that Rao “sat at puja when the kar sevaks began pulling down the mosque and rose only when the last stone had been removed”.

Salman Khurshid, who was a minister of state at the time, said the central government was “dazed”.

Interestingly, years later at an event at Aligarh Muslim University, a college student asked Khurshid about riots and events – including the opening of the Babri Masjid’s gates – that had taken place under the Congress. He asked how the Congress would wash “Muslim blood on its hands”.

Khurshid replied : “I am also a part of the Congress so let me admit that we have blood on our hands.” The Congress promptly distanced itself from his comments.

Finally, in 2019, when the Supreme Court passed its verdict in the disputed land case, the Congress politely said it respected the verdict and was in favour of a temple.

But can we really expect any better from a party so muddled about itself?

This is the fundamental failing of the Congress party. It’s unable to counter the BJP’s Hindutva because, at the end of the day, what ideology does it offer? In marketing the Ram Mandir, the BJP is unmatched. The party has most of the country convinced that this is one of the greatest civilisational achievements they’ll ever witness. As a result, the Congress can’t stand against it without political cost.

It’s an echo of Rajiv’s Congress and Rao’s Congress from decades ago, compelled to switch between support and dismay, unlocking a gate or disappearing into prayer. In the 40-odd years that have gone by, the Congress is almost exactly the same, caught in a cycle of going along with popular sentiment because it can’t afford to do otherwise.

In the specific case of attending the consecration, the party has made a decision that seems right and fair. But its lack of clarity will continue to be a stumbling block, unless a lot changes very quickly."

After all, it’s the first time in Ayodhya’s history that the keys of a temple as grand are not fully in the hands of the saffron-cloaked.

While the sant samaaj in Ayodhya is enthused about the Ram temple, there is disquiet too – about the new idol, the priest leading the ceremony, the process of appointment, and the sidelining of prominent seers part of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement – with more powers to Sangh Parivar members and retired government officials comprising the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust .

The Narendra Modi government’s decision to hand over the temple’s management to a trust stems from the Supreme Court’s verdict in 2019, but there have been objections, primarily from seers of the Ramanandi sect, whose existence is closely tied to the temple town – which forms the epicentre of its principal akharas Nirvani, Nirmohi and Digambar.

Though it’s not just seers from the Ramanandi akharas who are disappointed.

The shankaracharyas from the Shaivaite tradition have also announced the decision to not attend the consecration ceremony on January 22 over the trust’s decision to inaugurate an “incomplete” temple in violation of the shastras. The shankaracharya of the north peeth, Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, has called for the removal of Champat Rai, the trust’s general secretary and the VHP’s international vice president, as “he is not a Ramanandi.”

But the question of who should have rightful control over the conduct of worship such as puja and bhog in the new temple is also being fiercely debated among the Ramanandi akharas, who have been the custodians of the makeshift temple and were in charge of the worship of the Ram Lalla idol until the Supreme Court’s final verdict in November 2019.

The new arrangement, after all, marks a break in the established tradition of the Ramanandi akharas controlling the management of big temples – Hanumangarhi and Ram Janmabhoomi – and collecting all the offerings from devotees and patrons. And this reduced influence of Ramanandi seers in the new temple’s management, they claim, has jeopardised the dominance of the sect’s akharas over Ayodhya.

“In Ayodhya, we have a tradition of sadhus and a system of mahants, not of any trust,” Dharam Das, head of the Nirvani akhara, told Newslaundry, claiming that not a single religious establishment in the town was in favour of the trust’s working.

Dating back to the 15th century, the Ramanandi sect is one of the largest Vaishnavite ascetic sects in India and Nepal. It embraces “twice-born” Hindus, or the first three groups of the Hindu caste system, as well as women, lower castes, and even Muslim Harijan devotees. Ramanandis consider Lord Ram as the tutelary deity and Ayodhya as the centre of the universe from where he ruled in the Treta Yug. The Ramanandi, along with Shaivaite and Sikh akharas, together form the akhara parishad which organises the Kumbh melas.

Sidelining of Ramanandi akharas

The seers’ resentment against the trust has been on open display for some years, with charges ranging from corruption in land deals to allegedly fraudulent land grabs at Angad Tila , adjoining the Janmabhoomi precinct.

In his book Ayodhya: The Dark Night , author Dhirendra Jha wrote that the Nirmohi akhara had claimed ownership of the Ram Chabutra – a raised platform constructed inside the Babri Masjid compound in 1858 and popularly known as the birthplace of lord Ram – until Abhiram Das, a priest from the Nirvani akhara, secretly installed the idol of infant Ram inside the mosque structure in the intervening hours of December 22 and December 23 in 1949.

Since that day, the worship of Ram Lalla had been overseen by the seers of the Nirvani akhara, chiefly the disciples of Abhiram Das, who is renowned as the Janmabhoomi Uddharak Baba. The makeshift temple has now come under the control of the trust and has no representation of the Nirvani akhara.

“Sadhus belonging to the Ramanandi akharas have been critical to the struggle of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Now that the temple is being constructed, they are discarding us by not giving us a place on the trust, which appears to be a deliberate move,” Tejpal Das, president of the Hanumangarhi temple, the main shrine in Ayodhya managed by the Nirvani akhara, told Newslaundry."

The report was published on Friday and was headlined “A top Biden official is pushing an urgent post-Gaza plan that’s alarming some insiders” . According to the report, diplomat Brett McGurk is promoting a controversial plan to rebuild Gaza which has left many in the White House concerned about how it could negatively impact the region. “In this vision, Palestinian leaders would agree to a new government for both Gaza and the occupied West Bank and to ratchet down their criticisms of Israel, while Israel would accept limited influence in Gaza,” read the report.

Senior diplomatic correspondent Ahmed insisted that he had included anonymous quotes of several American officials in the piece.

However, he tweeted on Saturday that National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson had responded to his request for comment by completely denying his quotes. He wrote, “20 hours after my deadline – now my story has been read by >150k people — WH has sent comment. Spox Adrienne Watson: ‘This story is not true. Quotes attributed to US officials are made up. Watson played no role in my interviews. My quotes are real. Biden team again echoing Trump.”

“I sent the WH detailed questions + criticisms based on very reliable sources; I also extended my deadline at their request. They chose not to engage yesterday & have now decided they have to. They can’t actually dispute the story on its merits so they’re resorting to lies,” he said.

“Earlier in the day, a contact told me a US official they contacted about my story said I lack credibility & am seen as an extremist. Such smear tactics in response to scrutiny & journalism are scary – and reflective of the Trump-style thinking Biden is selling himself as opposing,” he said. “Baseless claims of lies have defined much of the Biden admin’s deeply controversial public response to Oct 7, from questioning Gaza’s death toll to denying a basis for fears of war crimes. They haven’t quelled huge public frustration or alarm among natsec folks in & outside gov.”

Ahmed said he will “stand by my reporting & I’ll keep aggressively covering US foreign policy, as I’ve done for more than a decade”.

MSNBC’s Chris Hayes tweeted , “Utterly embarrassing, gross and unprofessional response from @NSC_Spox.”

Alex Ward, a national security writer at Politico, tweeted , “Akbar is a brilliant, careful and thoughtful reporter. To even insinuate that he would make up quotes is beyond the pale.”

Sabrina Siddiqui, White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal, wrote , “@AkbarSAhmed is a stellar reporter whose coverage of the conflict has been essential reading. It’s one thing to dispute a story or aspects of it, but to suggest a reporter is making up quotes is a serious accusation and not in any way reflective of Akbar’s professionalism.”

Washington Post journalist Evan Hill tweeted, “Truly bizarre response from the administration to

@AkbarSAhmed's enlightening story on Brett McGurk's plan for post-war Gaza.”

Washington Post editorial board member Shadi Hamid wrote, “This is a new escalation, and in all my years interviewing US officials I've never seen anything like it. The White House is smearing a great reporter@AkbarSAhmed without basis, simply because he was able to get the scoop on Brett McGurk's frightening postwar plans for Gaza.”

New York Times journalist Bill Carter tweeted, “At what pt does Biden Admin take charge of disaster in Gaza and stop allowing Netanyahu and his extreme right govt play them like a fiddle? It’s enormously damaging to Biden, and US in general. Treating press like this is clanging alarm that they can’t even get msg-ing straight.”"

The Central government has reportedly told the court that it will not notify its fact check unit until the order is pronounced.

The court was earlier scheduled to pronounce its judgment on December 1 last year. And on December 1, it decided to defer its verdict until January 5, 2024. On January 5, it deferred it until January 15.

The new IT Rules gives the government “unfettered power” in absence of any “guidelines and guardrails”, the Bombay High Court had observed in September last year while hearing petitions challenging the amendments.

The division bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Neela Gokhale had also questioned the government over the need for the amendment and the provision for a separate fact check unit despite the establishment of the Press Information Bureau fact check.

“You have a PIB which has its presence on social media. Why then was this amendment required and (the need) for an FCU to be set up? I think this amendment wants to do something more,” asked Justice Patel. Pointing out that the government was the “sole arbiter without any checks and balances”, he had emphasised the need to set up guidelines.

Representing the government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said the PIB’s fact check unit was “teethless”.

“The IT Rules are not related to curbing free speech at all. The government is not trying to proscribe and prohibit any expression of opinion, criticism, or comparative analysis...in fact we welcome them, encourage them and learn from them,” he had said, adding that the rules have “nothing to do with humour or satire…as far as the content does not cross the line”.

The petitions were filed by stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra, the Editors Guild of India and the Association of Indian Magazines, terming the rules as arbitrary and unconstitutional.

The amendment, originally notified on April 6 last year, said social media companies and other intermediaries must take down content deemed fake by a government fact-check unit. It was widely criticised by press groups, opposition leaders and journalists. Kamra’s plea, filed a few days later, said the rules “have a chilling effect and are enough to chill people”."

The 51-year-old has already spent 12 years in jail serving multiple sentences. She has campaigned for human rights in Iran and is accused of spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic while behind the bars.

Fifty metres away, her husband Jairaj Malik creates a pool of water to make the mud malleable. Spade in hand, the 48-year-old works his way through mounds of clay, breaking them down to a dough-like consistency for his wife to shape into bricks.

Working as a team, the husband and wife aim to earn at least Rs 1,000 ($12) every day.

They have to send their three children to school, afford healthcare for Jairaj’s ageing mother and plough some of it back into their land in Odisha, more than 1,400 kms from Gudahatti village. The Maliks sell some of the vegetables and rice they grow, but most of it is for their own consumption.

“I have been doing this work from 6 am to 5 pm for the last 20 years,” said Jamuna, who is in her 30s, her fingers continuously patting mud into the mould.

There is now a certain comfort and familiarity with Karnataka, the kiln owners, and the life they have created here, and to which they have repeatedly returned over the past two decades.

The salubrious weather in the southern state helps too given the back-breaking manual work of brick making. They say they can work more efficiently in these conditions, and are spared the extreme heat and cold of northern India.

“I learnt this work after I got married and have travelled with my husband almost every year since,” said Jamuna.

“Earlier our children would accompany us, but now the older two stay back in Odisha to study. It has become a way of our life.”

The Maliks’ way of life is about to change. As is that of more than 17 million people working in this critical sector for the rapidly expanding construction industry.

India’s traditional brick kiln industry, which people like the Maliks are an integral part of, is under scrutiny for being “highly polluting” and having “low energy efficiency”, as a World Bank report put it, besides being heavily dependent on coal.

According to research in 2023 by science journal Nature, the largely unorganised sector produces 233 billion bricks every year, using about 35 million tonnes of coal and 25 million tonnes of biomass.

India, the world’s most-populous country with an ever-rising demand for electricity, accounts for 14 percent of global coal demand, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

In a report published in December 2023, IEA said the global demand for coal exceeded 8.5 billion tonnes for the first time as usage in India was expected to grow 8 percent and that in China by 5 percent.

The consumption of coal - considered the dirtiest fossil fuel and a major source of CO2 emissions responsible for global warming - is not expected to decline until at least 2026.

Yet, India has committed to cutting its ratio of greenhouse emissions to gross domestic product by 2030 to 45 percent of its 2005 level and to net zero by 2070.

Towards that end, the government outlined emission standards for brick kilns in 2018, followed by a number of orders from both the states and centre mandating kiln owners to switch to technologies that will cut dependency on coal.

Many missed deadlines and court cases later, several Indian states are now pushing for such a conversion by March. This has led to growing concerns over the closure of non-complying kilns and the subsequent loss of jobs among worker collectives.

“There are many unanswered questions around this transition in the sector,” said Gurpriya Singh, a campaigner with Buniyaad Initiative. “The key one being will the shift to new technology improve the lives of the workers, ensure a better work environment, and address occupational health concerns.”

Buniyaad Initiative is a collective of 60 kiln owners, workers’ unions, non-profits, researchers and pollution control board officials working to address the challenges of brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh, which has a high concentration of kilns along its Gangetic plains

“Most kilns are an extension of the agriculture sector, co-existing on a patch of land near a farm. These are small, operate seasonally and are unlikely to have any financial support to transition. The fear of their closure is real.”"

The plot is 25 kilometres away from the heart of Ayodhya and in the vicinity of an old shrine.

As goats graze on the ground and children play cricket, Mohammad Zilam Khan sits on a charpoy, and points to the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation signboard with an old construction plan which has now been revised.

“The media comes each day. They ask questions and leave. Nothing is happening here. There has been talk of a mosque ever since the Supreme Court order. But is anything happening here? What do we tell you? We don’t have any hope,” says Anees Khan, who lives near the site.

“If there was a brick we would’ve told you if the mosque would be built,” says Wasid Khan, another local.

But why hasn’t construction started?

Two members of the IICF told Newslaundry that a delay in a no-objection certificate and a paucity of funds are the primary reasons for the delay.

The foundation’s spokesperson Athar Hussain says, “The funds haven’t come in yet…even if we get clearance, we have to submit a big amount to the Ayodhya development authorities. It can only happen if we get funds. And only then will we be able to tell you when the mosque will be constructed.”

Maharashtra BJP leader Haji Arfat Shaikh is reportedly the new chief of the mosque’s development committee, which aims to build one of the biggest mosques in India. The previous plan, by professor SM Akhtar, the founder-dean of the faculty of architecture at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University, had included a hospital, community kitchen, library, and a research centre, across 4,500 square metres.

That was in the 1990s, when the great Indian traveller was yet to take wing and when India’s policy with its neighbours was not yet straitjacketed by China. Three decades later, more Indians have travelled abroad, yet there is even less public appreciation that India’s neighbours, however small, are each sovereign, culturally distinct, speak languages that are not Hindi or its variants, value their independence, and make economic and foreign policy decisions based on their own national interests.

Not vassals

Whether it’s Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, or the Maldives, Indians want smaller nations in the neighbourhood to show gratitude and “loyalty,” forgetting that these are not vassals but countries with their own diversities and political dynamics, in which India’s size and its economic and military power are admired and envied but are also a matter of concern.

Today, large sections of hypernationalist Indians would be happiest if India would just flex its military muscle to show the Maldives – population-wise the size of a Delhi neighbourhood – who’s boss. For those who see foreign policy as zero-sum games, it has been difficult to understand that Maldivian voters have elected a leader who, instead of waiting for an invitation from Delhi to show his fealty, decided that Turkey would be his first official port of call. Never mind that India could not fit him in even after that, and he took up Beijing’s invitation next.

Instead of a push-back from the top against such simplistic views of the neighbourhood, there seems to be an increasing willingness in Delhi’s top policy-making circles to hand over difficult diplomatic challenges to the thuggish social media street. Where India’s National Security Guard once saved a besieged Maldivian leader from an attempted coup, a landmark high-point in India's neighbourhood policy, now India’s designated IT cells and troll armies believe they have scored big by getting Indians to cancel their honeymoons and snorkelling holidays in the Maldives, and Indian travel biggies to cancel bookings en masse.

Trolling as diplomacy

This is not the first time that those in charge of India’s foreign policy have ceded space to social media. In the spat over the Nijjar killing, once Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went public with concerns about the possible involvement of the Indian government in the incident, the official badmouthing of Canada was a cue for social and electronic media to begin an all-out attack on #Canadistan (by the way, #justsaying, it’s a country that a lot of Indians call home, so there must be something about this “North American Pakistan” that remains hugely attractive to large numbers of people who want to leave India).

On Israel’s brutal war in Gaza, in which over 23,000 civilians have been killed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s signalling of all-out support to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, appeared to have been taken by IT cells as a green light to launch a social media war against Hamas, Palestinians and Muslims in general. The fake posts generated from Indian handles have embarrassed even the Israeli Defence Forces, and earned India a place in a hall of fame of its own.

What happens in India...

The total population of the Maldives, an archipelago of 26 atolls, is not more than 5,00,000. After three decades of one-man rule, it is only since 2008 that the Maldives has had free and fair multiparty elections. It’s a noisy democracy. No leader has been elected twice. Its people are apparently unafraid of interrogating their leaders. Despite its seeming isolation in the Indian Ocean, this Islamic nation was not untouched by 9/11 and its aftermath. Wahabism, Al-Qaeda, and, in later years, ISIS, all found traction in the Maldives.

Unable to counter hardline Islamism with blanket bans on hijab and beards, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom – the absolute ruler for three decades from 1978, winning six straight terms in one-party elections – was persuaded to agree to democratic reforms in the early years of the 21st century. India was the beacon of democracy in the region and inspired many in the Maldivian Democratic Party. But India’s own turn to Hindutva, the open Muslim-baiting since 2014 incidents of mob violence against Muslims, and Karnataka’s hijab row have not helped the case of those Maldivians who have wanted closer ties with Delhi.

Despite the “India First” policy of the previous Ibrahim Solih government, in 2021, the Maldives was forced by domestic compulsions to join in the condemnation of the former BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma’s remarks against Prophet Mohammed. Solih’s decision to criminalise anti-India protests by presidential decree did not help. All this fed into the “India Out” campaign, which began on social media with local influencers wanting to know why Indian military personnel are stationed in the Maldives.

A political agenda became apparent when former President Abdulla Yameen took leadership. But as India knows from its own experience, political agendas in foreign affairs and national security are not unique to the Maldives. Which self-respecting country wants foreign troops on its soil or can paper over it in the hope that people will not come to know?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reasons for promoting Lakshadweep as a tourist destination suddenly are not entirely clear. The place has no tourist infrastructure. No super-luxury resorts where film stars can Instagram themselves during fully paid for promotional holidays or where models can pose for the Kingfisher calendar. And Lakshadweep’s corals got bleached decades ago.

The last time the fully Muslim Union Territory in the Arabian Sea grabbed headlines was over the actions of its administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, a controversial political appointee. His first decisions there in 2021 triggered a ‘Save Lakshadweep Campaign’. At the time, no one on social media took up this cry for help from Lakshadweep. No wonder that when the Prime Minister wrote “go to Lakshadweep”, Indian social media warriors quickly read it as “teach Maldives a lesson”.

That President Muizzu’s ministers joined the fray with personal attacks on Prime Minister Modi was inexcusable. He could have sacked them to send a more conciliatory message to India, but with a parliamentary election coming up in April, Muizzu is unlikely to back down. The opposition’s victory in the Male mayoral contest is being celebrated in India as if Muizzu has lost his own election. It will mean more anti-India rhetoric as elections draw closerHis March 15 deadline for Indian troops to leave the country, despite ongoing negotiations on this issue with India, has to be seen in this context.

Maldives knows that India is its closest neighbour, and rhetoric aside, Delhi has to be the first responder to any crisis in that country, whether it’s a natural disaster or a water shortage like in 2014. But for the present, as indicated by the Maldivian president’s visit to China in the middle of the row with India, India-Maldives relations are bound to be uneven. Among the slew of agreements he signed in Beijing was one evidently aimed at reducing food dependence on India. He has also taken steps to reduce health and medical dependence on India. Maldives’s small size was not a licence to bully it, he added.

Muizzu has not yet said anything about the Indian development of a naval harbour for the Maldivian National Defence Force at Uthuru Thila Falhu atoll, for which Defence Minister Rajnath Singh laid the foundation stone last year. Nor has he spoken about the $500 million Greater Male Connectivity Project, the largest infrastructure project in the Maldives, being developed by the Indian AFCONS, with Delhi providing a $100 million grant and a $400 million line of credit.

Now that social media has wrought its damage, it will be up to the diplomats on both sides to pick up the pieces. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s remark, “politics is politics,” has come a little late in the day, but it conveys well that diplomacy is hard work with no guaranteed results.

Neighbours watching

The Maldives may find Chinese and other tourists to replace Indians. And Indians may still head to the Maldives. But Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and even an apparently friendly Bangladesh would have watched this latest episode in India-Maldives ties with considerable interest. Like the Maldives, Sri Lanka’s economy too is dependent on tourism to a large extent. Nepal is a landlocked neighbour that has been blockaded by India twice, and believes in the slogan that India uses for 26/11: “Never forget”. India once withdrew fuel subsidies to Bhutan.

The ferocity of the social media attack, and the participation of Indian celebrities in it would have only confirmed the traditional insecurities about “big brother” that these countries harbour. The India-Maldives row may be about bilateral ties, but it will send ripples around the neighbourhood, making India's Neighbourhood First policy more complicated and difficult than it is already."

Australian-Lebanese radio host and columnist Antoinette Lattouf was fired last month, only three days into her short-term contract.

In its Tuesday edition, the news daily Sydney Morning Herald claimed that a chain of WhatsApp messages obtained by it revealed that a group called Lawyers for Israel had lobbied for Lattouf’s sacking.

The journalist’s dismissal came soon after she posted a Human Rights Watch report on social media alleging that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. The broadcaster too had covered the report.

Lattouf challenged her dismissal as unlawful, saying she was sacked on the grounds of “political opinion or a reason that included political opinion”. One of her lawyers, Josh Bornstein, claimed on X that the sacking was “based on both political opinion and race”.

Her case is due to be heard by Australia’s Fair Work Commission. In its defence to the commission, ABC denied that Lattouf’s sacking was connected to her race or political opinion.

Several journalists across the world have lost their jobs or have been suspended over their stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict since October 7 last year, when the escalated fighting between Hamas and Israel began."

But at least two of those drugs, sourced by the Delhi government’s central procurement agency, were procured in an alleged violation of norms as their manufacturers had been blacklisted after their other medicines failed lab tests in several states, Newslaundry has found.

This came before these two pharma firms were counted among the six manufacturers whose drugs were declared as not standard quality, or NSQ, by Delhi’s drugs control department in September last year. A subsequent report by vigilance officials triggered a war of words between the elected government of Delhi and Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena in December. And a CBI probe was recently launched.

The six NSQ drugs include cephalexin 500 mg by Jackson Laboratories Pvt Ltd, sodium valproate 200 mg by Zee Laboratories Ltd, amlodipine 5mg by Adroit Pharmaceuticals Ltd, levetiracetam 500 mg by Regent Ajanta Biotech, and dexamethasone 4 mg by Medicamen Organics Pvt Ltd. Some of these drugs were used to treat inflammation, some for seizures, and some to control blood pressure.

However, of the six firms behind these drugs, as many as 61 drug samples of Zee Laboratories Ltd and 45 of Jackson Laboratories had failed the lab test in various states since 2011, according to data maintained by Maharashtra, Gujarat and Jharkhand governments. Separately, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, the central regulator for drugs, had also declared 54 drug samples of Jackson and 27 of Zee as NSQ over the last five years.

In addition, Zee and Jackson have been blacklisted by medical procurement bodies of state governments in Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Karnataka, Assam, Chhattisgarh and Punjab between 2018 and 2023. In December 2022, Nepal also debarred Zee from accessing its market for non-compliance with World Health Organisation’s manufacturing standards.

Testing and procurement

In the most recent case, samples for testing were taken from three Delhi government-run hospitals – Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital and Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences – in July-August last year. Six drugs from six manufacturers failed the test.

According to a report by the Lieutenant Governor-controlled Directorate of Vigilance dated December 5, 2023 on the sub-standard samples, five of these drugs were sourced by the central procurement agency – which works under the Delhi government’s directorate general of health services – while levetiracetam was procured through a “local distributor”. The tenders for the six drugs were issued in 2020 and 2021, claimed DGHS sources and a director of one of the six firms.

Meanwhile, in the latest showdown with the Arvind Kejriwal government, Delhi L-G Saxena had last month recommended a CBI probe into the supply of “substandard drugs to the Delhi hospitals as the investigation therein involves multi inter-state stakeholders including CPA, GNCTD, suppliers/dealers, manufacturers in other states and other agencies”. He also suggested that the central agency may check if these “substandard” drugs were supplied to Mohalla Clinics, the flagship health programme of the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government.

The central government swiftly recommended a CBI inquiry.

The sample collection exercise at the three Delhi hospitals was allegedly led by the directorate of vigilance while the drug inspectors which operate under the Delhi government remained mute spectators, an official privy to the sampling claimed. “Everything was done by the L-G office; drug inspectors who are authorised to collect samples were mute spectators,” he claimed.

However, special secretary (vigilance) YVVJ Rajasekhar and the L-G are yet to respond to such allegations from the Delhi government, which is under fire over the issue.

Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had earlier “welcomed” the CBI probe, saying that only five drugs were found NSQ. (The sixth test result came later). He also targeted Delhi health secretary SB Deepak Kumar for allegedly not paying heed to his direction of auditing medicines. Kumar, however, called Bharadwaj’s claim “half truths” and “baseless”.

Failing quality tests in several states

A drug can be defined NSQ if it fails to pass the quality test and does not comply with the Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) standards. The reason for failed tests vary: dissolution, salt content, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxins, faulty description, sterility, etc.

The other medicines of these two firms – Zee Laboratories Ltd and Jackson Laboratories – that were declared NSQ were used to cure inflammation, clotting, seizures, gastro ailments, blood pressure, malaria, bacterial infection, decongestion etc.

With an annual turnover of Rs 100 crore, Jackson Laboratories’ drug samples failed lab tests 57 times since 2018, according to the monthly drug alert bulletin issued by the national regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, on medicines which “are not of standard quality/spurious/adulterated/misbranded”. Majority of them failed the test for dissolution which refers to time taken by a drug to get dissolved in the bloodstream. At least 13 of them were found to be adulterated with particulate matter. A few were contaminated with bacterial endotoxins.

Adulterated or endotoxin contaminated drugs can harm or even lead to death of patients.

Dinesh Thakur, a public health activist and co-author of The Truth Pill-The Myth of Drug Regulation in India, said bacterial endotoxins are “the worst form of contaminants”.

That’s not all.

According to data from Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat, Jackson – established in 1980 with two manufacturing units in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh – has failed NSQ tests 45 times since 2011.

The track record of Zee Laboratories is equally unenviable. Its drugs have failed lab tests 27 times since 2018, as per CDSCO data. The key reasons were non-compliance with IP parameters on dissolution and salt content. Some were found contaminated with particulate matter and bacteria.

In July last year, Zee’s sodium valproate tablets failed the test for non-compliance with salt content, according to CDSCO. The same tablets were found NSQ in the Delhi drug test too.

The data from Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Gujarat shows that Zee had 61 cases of NSQ since 2011.

Of the six firms in the CBI’s line of fire, drugs from Zee, Gentech, Regent Ajanta and Jackson failed the dissolution test while Adroit’s sample was declared NSQ for related substance and Medicamen for assay (salt content).

Blacklisted

According to two government sources and an industry insider, the tenders for drug supply to government hospitals were granted by the Delhi government’s medicine procurement arm, or the central procurement agency, in 2020 and 2021.

Almost all CPA tenders specify that companies that are blacklisted and whose drugs are NSQ are not allowed to participate in the bidding process. But before 2020 and 2021, Jackson and Zee were blacklisted by at least four states and the implementing agency of the central government’s Jan Aushadhi programme.

Jackson was blacklisted by Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), which implements the central government’s flagship Jan Aushadi programme, for two years beginning January 2019. Its vitamin C tablets failed the assay test, which refers to the salt content.

Odisha had debarred the firm in 2017 for a period of three years for supplying sub-standard pantoprazole tablets.

In Jammu and Kashmir, Jackson’s product B complex tablets were debarred by the Medical Supplies Corporation Ltd, a government undertaking, for two years beginning February 2021.

The firm was also blacklisted for two years up to December 2022 by the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Corporation (TNMSC) in December 2020.

Jackson was blacklisted last year by Karnataka for five years starting with 2023. The order was issued by Karnataka State Medical Supplies Corporation Ltd after Jackson’s two injection samples were found NSQ.

Similarly, Zee Laboratories was also debarred for two years up to December 2022 by the Tamil Nadu Medical Service Corporation in December 2020. This was revealed during technical bidding for drugs supply in Punjab in November the same year.

Before this, Assam’s National Health Mission office debarred Zee from participating in any bid for five years starting from the year 2018. Zee’s Amoxicillin oral suspension, an antibiotic, failed the drug test.

In an order by Odisha State Medical Corporation Ltd in October 2018, Zee was debarred for three years for supplying sub-standard paracetamol for children.

Chhattisgarh Medical Services Corporation Ltd blacklisted Zee’s lithium carbonate tablets for five years beginning from July 2023.

In 2022, Zee was among 16 pharma companies that were blacklisted by Nepal.

Lack of due diligence by Delhi govt?

Between 2020 and 2021 when the tenders for drug supply were issued, Jackson was blacklisted by at least two states and the Jan Aushadhi agency, and Zee by three states. The CPA tenders specifically debar blacklisted firms from participating.

When asked how these two firms could bid for tenders whey they were blacklisted, Dr Arvind Mohan, head of the central procurement agency, refused to comment, saying it had been just one week since he joined the office.

“When a firm applies for tender, it has to share details if it is blacklisted or facing prosecution,” said a source at the Delhi government’s directorate general of health services, under which CPA works. The source was tight-lipped when asked if CPA checked the track record of Zee and Jackson.

Prashant Reddy T, a public health activist and co-author of The Truth Pill, a book on drug regulation in India, asked if the Delhi government had carried out due diligence.

“Blacklisted companies are typically not allowed to participate in the public procurement process. The fact that these companies managed to sell their drugs to the Delhi government despite being allegedly blacklisted by other companies raises questions about whether Delhi has conducted sufficient ‘due diligence’,” said Reddy.

But how did these firms escape CPA’s scrutiny?

One tender for supply of drugs throws some light on this. Zee and Jackson participated in a drug supply tender issued by the Punjab Health Systems Corporation in November 2022. While evaluating technical bids by the two firms, PHSC asked them why they participated when they stood blacklisted by a Tamil Nadu undertaking up to December 2022.

To this, Zee and Jackson gave identical replies, saying their subsidiaries were debarred and in this tender, other firms of their group were the participants. PHSC allowed Zee to bid but refused similar leeway to Jackson."

It received mixed reviews (a polite way to say it sucked), had a limited theatrical run, and went quite unnoticed.

But we can’t afford not to notice it anymore.

Soon after Annapoorani released on Netflix on December 29, it ran into controversy. Activists from the Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Hindu IT Cell filed two separate police complaints against Netflix, the filmmakers and others for promoting “love jihad”, that good old conspiracy theory, and hurting the feelings of the Brahmin community. The Thane police swiftly registered an FIR.

Zee Studios, one of the film’s producers, promptly apologised and directed Netflix to remove the film. Their response suggested Annapoorani might be restored after editing out parts that are supposedly offensive.

The forcible removal of the film, which was already passed by the Central Board of Film Certification, led to outrage on social media. While the majority of the Tamil film industry chose not to react, filmmakers Vetrimaaran and Pa Ranjith condemned the censoring of cinema through “external pressure”.

Meanwhile, the controversy piqued the curiosity of not only the Tamil public but movie-watchers across the country. They may not have paid attention to the film before but now, they badly wanted to know why it’s so controversial. Since Annapoorani is no longer on OTT platforms, it’s now being actively shared through torrents, Telegram and other illegal means.

Small censorship, big publicity

But the events surrounding Annapoorani aren’t new. Such censorship and outrage have happened time and again. And these objections haven’t been raised only by Hindutva outfits, but by other religious, political and caste power centres as well.

Popular Tamil writer Perumal Murugan came under attack in 2014 for the contents of his book Mathorubhagan, or One Part Woman in English. It supposedly offended the sensibilities of caste-based and religious Hindu groups in the western Kongu belt of Tamil Nadu. The police brokered a “peace talk” between the writer and the protesting groups and forced him to unconditionally apologise and withdraw all copies of the book. The turn of events eventually pushed the writer to give up his craft and declare “Perumal Murugan, the writer, is dead”.

However, responding to a series of litigations and suits, the Madras High Court ruled in favour of Perumal Murugan, who returned to writing in 2016. While he was already popular in Tamil reading circles, the controversy brought him nation-wide attention. His work was translated into English and sales spiked.

Also in 2013, Kamal Hassan was gearing up to release Vishwaroopam when it ran into trouble with the AIADMK government led by J Jayalalithaa. A group of Muslim civic groups requested the chief minister to intervene and edit portions of the film that portrayed Tamil Muslim characters as terrorists.

As Kamal, the film’s actor, co-writer, co-producer and director, attempted to dodge pressure to edit the film, the high court stayed his film’s release. A dejected Kamal addressed the press saying the film’s non-release might eat up all his savings and that he wanted to “leave the country”.

This resulted in huge outrage, both online and offline. Angered fans and non-fans extended their solidarity to Kamal and vowed to ensure Vishwaroopam’s release and success. Some even sent Kamal their savings and requested him to continue making films in India.

Kamal finally agreed to requested changes, Vishwaroopam released, and it was a huge commercial success."

Haseena Shaik, an associate editor with TV9, was on the ground on January 13, covering Sankranti celebrations in Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada. At one point, she sat behind former Andhra Pradesh civil supplies minister Kodali Nani of the YSRCP, while the minister participated in a bike rally.

This clip of this segment of the show is being used to insinuate a sexual relationship between the minister and the journalist.

Many TDP members including the party’s state organising secretary, Sistla Lohith, took to Twitter and shamed Haseena for the segment which was aired on January 14. It featured Sankranti festivities and cock-fighting contests, and was planned with Kodali Nani, who was decked up in traditional wear for the semi-scripted show.

Haseena had to follow the leader from one point to another, which is why she decided to ride pillion with him, the journalist told The News Minute. “I have been working with TV9 since 2005. There is a general feeling among TDP supporters that TV9 does not grant proper coverage to their party, because of which they are targeting me. The worrying part is that official handles of small scale TDP leaders also reposted the video with such tweets,” said Haseena, referring to tweets implying a relationship between her and the minister.

“If they feel my channel’s coverage is biased, they can take it up with the management,” said the journalist. “They did not even consider the fact that I am a woman. I have reported on important issues like the Kedarnath floods and the Ukraine war, and have never supported any one party in my coverage. I will now complain to the AP Mahila Commission and to the National Commission for Women. This issue needs to be addressed.”

Following the barrage of derogatory comments against the journalist, the Network of Women in Media, India issued a statement stating that it “strongly condemns” it. The media body called for “immediate and serious action against cyber trolls and bullies attempting to silence journalists”.

Several independent YouTubers and Twitter handles also defended Haseena, saying that irrespective of the merits of the interview, such statements were derogatory and sexist in nature. “Statements like these reflect poorly on TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu and it will not be tolerated by female journalists like me,” said AimTV reporter Rupvani Konneru.

YouTuber Siddhu Manchikanti Potharaju also defended Haseena stating that while he had reservations about the interview itself, slut-shaming and insulting Haseena was completely distasteful and uncalled for."

To compensate for years of moderately-sped development, like several other tier-2 cities in India, Ayodhya is rushing to brush against the ribbon installed at the finish line. Widened roads, refurbished shops, intricate artwork, and clouds of construction dust – Ayodhya is gushing to celebrate the ‘return’ of Ram.

But, ahead of the consecration ceremony on January 22, which will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with several other VVIPs, the city may only be partially ready. A walk along the freshly renovated entry path into Ayodhya, and eventually to the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, displays a stark contrast in development works being undertaken. The ‘new’ Ayodhya appears half-done, much like the Ram temple will be on the day of the consecration.

Here’s a small glimpse."

The prominent non-profit organisation’s FCRA registration, which is mandatory to receive foreign funds, ceased on January 1, 2022 after it was denied licence renewal by the Union home ministry. In October last year, the Income Tax department also revoked its tax exemption status.

Seeking recourse in the Delhi High Court, the organisation filed an affidavit last week stating that three out of its seven development projects had to be terminated due to the lack of funds. It said the others too will be terminated soon.

“With the expected completion of termination of remaining projects by January 20, 2024, the petitioner will not have any projects in operation…This means that the petitioner will be without any work on the ground,” said the affidavit.

This comes days after Centre for Policy Research’s FCRA registration was cancelled by the Modi government.

At present, Oxfam India is operating with only 15 staff members as against its 251 staffers till December 2021. It said by March, the numbers will dwindle to four employees.

The organisation has shut all its Indian offices except the one in Delhi, which is also in the “process of closure due to a lack of available funds”, the affidavit said.

It added that the organisation spent Rs 7.04 crore from its reserves in FY2023 and in the current fiscal year, till November last year, it had spent Rs 3.36 crore from the reserves that currently stand at Rs 1.54 crore.

The organisation, which is also being investigated by the CBI, said it will not be able to pay salaries and social security benefits to its remaining staffers and pay the rent for its warehouses if its FCRA licence was not renewed.

The HC will hear the matter next on February 7."

And since 2017, Vicky Sharma, 33, has hit the city's roads every night during winter to help those without shelter. He searches for the homeless and distributes blankets to them.

Sharma, who was once homeless himself, is the general secretary of the Delhi Shelter Home Workers’ Union. “We rescue at least 50 people everyday. Since November 15, we have picked up 27 bodies of those who have died of cold on the road.”

Sharma has no family and used to live at Patel Chowk metro station till December 2014. He then began working as a caretaker at the Delhi government-run night shelters. Moving around in an ambulance van, donated to him by social activist Sunil Kumar Aledia, Sharma usually helps people in the Old Delhi area.

Aledia says 76 people are known to have died from cold between December 23 and January 5.

Every year, Sharma and his team of four to five people – most of them previously homeless – find the bodies of at least 60-70 people who succumbed to the cold. “In January, the cold peaks and more people pass away. This year, we expect more people to die as there are not enough shelters and government aid,” he said.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Tuesday said he had no previous record and that the Ujjain police investigating officer hadn’t conducted a “test identification parade”. The court also said the complainant and the eyewitness had retracted their testimonies and “did not support the case of the prosecution”.

But as Adnan walked out of jail this week, he returned to a life turned upside-down. His younger brother and a friend had got bail in the same case last year.

But the Mansooris’ home and shop was demolished two days after their arrest after right-wing activists demanded the government do so. The family was served a demolition notice just an hour before. Corporation officials had also brought in DJ and drummers at the site, who played Kailash Kher’s popular song Govinda Govinda from the movie Sarkar as the bulldozer razed their house and shop.

As a result, the family now lives in rented accommodation, according to Adnan’s lawyer Devender Sengar. Adnan’s father sells confectioneries from a cart to make ends meet.

Meanwhile, the other minor boy, a student of Class 9, dropped out of school. His father Mohammad Saleem said the “wild allegations” on news channels had resulted in “sleepless nights” for the family and made them “anxious”. The student’s school then refused to let him continue in the current academic session.

Details of the case, and backtracking

In July last year, a local athlete named Sawan Lot had filed a complaint against three “unknown boys”, alleging that his religious sentiments were hurt as they gurgled and spit on the Baba Mahakal religious procession.

Lot and Ajay Khatri, a local BJP leader and eyewitness in the case, have now turned hostile to the case. Even during the examination before the trial court, the complainant denied the allegations mentioned in the FIR.

However, Lot told Newslaundry that he had retracted under his family’s pressure as his father had allegedly been getting “death threats”. He said his father had suffered a cardiac arrest because of the stress and thus, he would submit his original statement again, accusing the three teenagers of spitting on the procession.

Notably, Lot has not filed any complaint against the death threats. Meanwhile, his deposing in favour of the Muslim teenagers has also not gone down well with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal’s Madhya Pradesh unit. “I want to file an FIR against the death threats. But I am looking for some support from the government,” he said.

The right-wing activists are now accusing Lot of being “unfaithful” to their god. Officials of VHP’s Madhya Pradesh unit said the bail granted to the three Muslim boys was “poor handling” of the case by the BJP.

One of the VHP leaders, Vinod Sharma, said, “We don’t know why Lot took a u-turn. But the eyewitness Ajay Khatri holds a special position in BJP Indore. I don't understand why he turned hostile.”

He said as the BJP had got “involved” in the matter, the VHP and Bajrang Dal had taken a back seat. “Soon, we will be holding a meeting to figure out how we can take this forward.”

Importantly, it wasn’t just right-wing groups that ran wild with the story. The “Ujjain thook kand” or “Ujjain spitting scandal” was top billing on primetime shows last July after the three teens were arrested. At least seven national and local news channels – India Today , Aaj Tak , News18 India , Zee News , News18 Rajasthan and News24 MP and Chhattisgarh – ran shows applauding the then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan’s government for the bulldozer action against the “culprits”.

Court errors and return home

The two 15-year-olds had spent three months in the juvenile detention centre as their bail plea was rejected by the Juvenile Justice Board and the sessions court in July last year. The court had said their release could bring them into “association with any known criminal” and it would “defeat the ends of justice”.

On granting them bail in September last year, the Madhya Pradesh HC called the lower court’s order “not sustainable in law”. It said the court had “erred,” committed “illegality” and “jurisdictional error” in rejecting the bail pleas.

The incident and the detention at the observation home “deeply affected” his son, said Saleem. “Because the false claims about my son went viral, everyone believed them. In our neighbourhood people started pointing to us that we had not raised him well. ”

Saleem, who runs a furniture shop, said his family has been suffering a lot, but the “biggest setback” was for the minor, as his school refused to accept him after the bail out. “He was in Class 9. But the school said they would not take him back as he would not be able to cope up with the academics. Who knows if it is the real reason.”

He added: “My son will have to repeat Class 9 in the next academic session. And because he can not attend school like his friends, it is embarrassing for him.”

The father said his son’s behaviour had drastically changed since he returned from the juvenile home. “He is always in fear and stress. He has stopped enjoying studies and doesn’t go out to play with his friends like earlier.”

Saleem said the minor is “still shocked” and has not been able to cope up with the fact that he was detained “for standing at his terrace and watching a religious procession pass by. Is that also a crime these days?”"

The report which collated data until December 1 last year said the total count of jailed journalists is the second-highest since the census began in 1992, indicating the “entrenched authoritarianism and the vitriol of governments” against independent voices.

The seven journalists incarcerated in India is also a record high for the country for the third consecutive year. The report said three journalists were released last year, but three more were also jailed.

Four out of these seven mediapersons are from Jammu and Kashmir, and five out of the total have been charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

India “continues to draw criticism” over its use of anti-terror laws, including the UAPAand the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act to “silence the media”, said the report.

The incarcerated journalists are Aasif Sultan of Kashmir Narrator, who has been in jail since August 2018; Sajad Gul of The Kashmir Walla, jailed since January 2022; independent journalist Rupesh Kumar Singh, jailed since July 2022; independent journalist Gautam Navlakha, under detention since April 2020; Prabir Purkayastha of NewsClick, who has been incarcerated since October last year; and independent journalists Majid Hyderi and Irfan Mehraj, in detention since September and March last year, respectively.
