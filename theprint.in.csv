An analysis by ThePrint of foreign direct investment (FDI) figures provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) shows that gross FDI into India in the first half (April-September) of this financial year stood at just $10.1 billion.

New Delhi: Foreign investments in India have fallen to near multi-decade lows in the current financial year, both in absolute terms as well as as a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).

Similarly, as a percentage of India’s GDP, gross FDI flows dropped to just 1 percent in the first half of financial year 2023-24, while net FDI fell to 0.6 percent. These are levels last seen in 2005-06.

The government has argued in Parliament that this fall in FDI flowing into India is because of a global slowdown. However, the analysis shows that while global FDI inflows have indeed fallen — largely because investments have stopped flowing into China and have begun flowing out — India’s share in global FDI inflows has also been falling.

In other words, global FDI inflows have been falling and India is receiving a decreasing share of what remains. India’s share in global FDI inflows fell to 2.8 percent in the January-June 2023 period, the lowest since 2017.

Economists and investment analysts say the reason behind India’s lacklustre FDI inflows, which have largely fallen as a percentage of GDP since 2014, is down to the policies of the Modi government.

To begin with, despite improvements in India’s ranking on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business index, actually doing business in India is still a difficult process impeded further by red tape.

The second major deterrent for foreign investors, they say, is India’s scrapping of all its Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). This deprived foreign companies of any protection from judicial proceedings in India.

The third factor is India’s stated policies on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Having signed one with Australia and the UAE, New Delhi has been trying to finalise similar trade pacts with the EU, the UK, and the US. This, analysts say, would give companies in those countries access to Indian markets without them having to invest here.

Sharp fall in FDI in recent years

In absolute terms, gross FDI inflows to India amounted to $10.1 billion in the first half of this financial year, down 60 percent from the same period of the previous financial year, which itself was down 16 percent from the first half of FY 2021-22.

October 2023 did see a surge in FDI of $7.3 billion, but that still put the current financial year’s total well below that of preceding years.

While absolute figures provide some insight into the money coming into the country, the expectation is that, as the economy grows, so will the funds flowing into India. A look at FDI as a percentage of GDP shows whether this has actually been the case.

During the first term of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), both gross FDI and net FDI shot up as a percentage of GDP — from 0.8 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, in FY 2004-05 to 3.5 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, in FY 2008-09.

Thereafter, it fell sharply again, perhaps in reaction to the global financial crisis in 2008-09. However, the UPA ended its 10 years in power with both gross and net FDI making up a higher percentage of GDP than when it came to power.

The Modi government has seen the opposite. Gross and net FDI as a percentage of GDP fell marginally over its first term, and the second term has seen both fall even faster.

“India’s FDI flow has been witnessing a declining trend,” Sumit Shekhar, an analyst at Delhi-based Ambit Capital said in a research note published this month. “A bigger concern is the rise in the share of reinvested earnings in net FDI inflows. This means the economy is struggling to attract newer investments as FDI in new equity grew by just 2.5 percent year-on-year in FY13-23 while reinvested earnings increased by 7 percent.”

He added that while FDI in services in India grew relatively strongly over the last decade, inflows into the manufacturing sector, led by sectors like automobiles and metallurgy, contracted.

Government policies to blame

While some of the recent slowdown in FDI in India could be explained due to what’s happening in the US, the longer trend of largely flat FDI over the last decade is due to a perceived lack of genuine ease of doing business, according to D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India.

“Recently, over the last year-and-a-half, the US interest rates were hiked and a lot of money was flowing back to the US,” Srivastava said. “But over the last decade, the reason for FDI not growing along with the economy is that genuine ease of doing business has not yet come in.”

“There are still a lot of constraints and rigidities and so investors are still reluctant to put their money in India,” he added.

Another major reason for India’s tepid FDI flows over the last decade has to do with India’s termination of the majority of its Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) — agreements between two countries that provide various protections to companies from one country investing in the other. One of these protections is that any arbitration or court case involving the company would take place in a third country, to eliminate any bias.

India had entered into BITs with 74 countries as of 2015, Minister of State (MoS) for External Affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh informed the Rajya Sabha in March 2023.

Of these 74, the government sent notices of termination to 68 countries and regions with a request to re-negotiate, while six BITs remain in force. After 2015, the Indian government signed four BITs, of which two are in force.

A June 2022 paper published in the peer-reviewed journal The Review of International Organizations found “a significant reduction in FDI inflows to India in response to BIT terminations by more than 30 percent compared to countries without terminations”.

“We identify the sudden break with investor protection for new investments as the major transmission channel,” the paper added.

Investment analysts agree with this assessment, saying that the terminations of BITs “majorly dented” investment flows into the country.

“When a company that doesn’t really know anything about India wants to invest here, it has fears about land acquisition, labour issues and various other things that can be taken to court,” an analyst from a leading research agency with its India headquarters in Mumbai, explained to ThePrint, on condition of anonymity.

“BITs used to provide that protection against court cases.”

“However, by terminating them, this government has removed those protections and the companies are no longer confident that they won’t be taken to an Indian court, the outcome of which is a foregone conclusion,” the analyst added.

The analyst also said that India’s eagerness to enter into FTAs signalled to companies around the world that they just had to wait for these agreements so that they get access to the Indian markets, without having to invest here.

India’s share in global FDI also falling

In December 2023, Minister of State (MoS) for Commerce and Industry Som Parkash told the Rajya Sabha that “FDI inflows have also been impacted by the threat of global recession, economic crisis due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, global protectionist measures and decline of real GDP growth rates of Singapore, USA and UK which are the major source countries for FDI”.

This assessment found many takers including Aditi Nayar, chief economist at the credit ratings agency ICRA, who said that India’s FDI situation needs to be looked at in the global context.

“The declining FDI flows to India aren’t surprising since this is in line with what’s happening globally,” Nayar told ThePrint.

“There appears to be an ongoing ‘funding winter’ in the startup sector. So, the factors driving this moderation in FDI are not specific to India.”

The data does show that India’s share in global FDI inflows has been largely increasing over the years, but it also shows that this share fell to just 2.8 percent in 2022-23, the lowest it has been since 2017.

“US investors are trying to shift away from China, but their preferred destinations are still Vietnam and South Korea and to some extent India, but here it’s only in some specific sectors of the economy,” Srivastava said, adding that “it is not broad-based”.

The simple method would be to compare the headline growth rates for different time periods and evaluate which is higher. However, there is a caveat. This approach assumes that growth in both the periods was equally likely. It overlooks the external conditions (like global slowdowns) that probably played a key role in influencing economic growth in a globalised economy.

Historically, economies like India and China operated like isolated islands. But starting with the 1991 economic reforms, successive Indian governments have followed a consistent reform policy (with some important failures). A key outcome of the reforms process, both in India and China, has the increased integration of these economies with the rest of the world.

Election season is approaching and understandably there is a need to assess performance—economic and political. For political performance, the outcome of the 2024 election is not known. But we can compare the economic performance of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government with that of the previous Congress dispensation during the high growth period from 2004 to 2013. Such a comparison is useful to understand, evaluate, and compare economic policies and their outcomes on economic growth.

Another frequently used comparison measure is to compute the potential growth rate of the economy. This is useful for determining whether the economy is in a positive or negative business cycle. Further, changes in the potential growth rate are important as they help better understand the long-term impact of economic policies (such as reforms). But how does one measure economic potential, and does that relate to the external environment?

This discussion is important because it highlights the challenges of comparing economic growth across two different periods—an exercise that analysts have been casually undertaking over the last several months. Unfortunately, such simplistic comparisons are inappropriate. In particular, they do not help in creating a better understanding of the influence of policies in shaping economic outcomes.

‘Excess growth’ is a better metric

To address the issue of comparing economic growth across time, we propose a simple metric based on two steps.

The first step is to take the population-weighted average growth of all countries, excluding India, for a given year. This gives us an estimate of global growth for that year. This captures the external growth environment—independent of India—and therefore provides us with a “reference” estimate of growth.

The next step is to subtract the global growth rate from India’s growth rate. We thus arrive at India’s excess growth. This excess growth rate is a reasonable measure to infer economic performance across different time periods. Naturally, the higher the excess growth, the better the economic performance.

India’s economic performance improved in 2014-2023

Before undertaking this analysis, a cautionary note. Both 2004-13 and 2014-23 experienced two global recessions. The first is the global financial crisis and the second is the Covid-19 pandemic. Many have compared these two events, but such a comparison is problematic on two counts. First, the 2020-21 pandemic caused a greater intensity of economic shock than the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Second, economic outcomes during the pandemic across the world were determined by public health choices, like lockdowns. Therefore, for the purpose of evaluating economic performance across time, these two years need to be dropped.

However, the inclusion of these years does not change the key result: India’s improved performance in 2014-23 compared to 2004-13.

A simple comparison of growth rate shows a drop from 7.8 per cent in 2004-13 (Period I) to 6.9 per cent in 2014-23 (Period II). However, global growth during Period II was 4 per cent compared to 5.6 per cent earlier. As a result, India’s excess growth is 0.9 percentage points (pp) higher in 2014-23 relative to 2004-13 (2.9 pp vs 2.2 pp). Therefore, the conclusion of better economic performance due to higher growth during Period I ignores the conducive external environment that facilitated this.

It is important that commentators recognise that the changing external environment renders the comparison of simple growth rates incorrect for the purpose of comparing economic performance.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and other Gulf nations, Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and many others in Asia and Africa are among those who constitute this dominant universe of political Islam that we are talking about.

For the greatest clarity, let’s say upfront that this is not an argument about Islam, the faith. This is about political Islam, where the faith is the state religion, defines a nation and/or maintains its mostly unelected leaders in power and determines their strategic responses.

For a moment, take your eye off the destruction in Gaza, the disruption in the Red Sea and the Iran-Pakistan tit-for-tat bombings that were followed by an incredible equivalent of the brotherly pappi-jhappi (hugs and kisses). Now, depending on which way you look at it, global political Islam is at its strongest ever, or its weakest.

Further, there are the many non-state actors. Some of them, like the Houthis and Hezbollah, flaunt arsenals bigger than most regular states.

In fact, both are bigger than most European countries in terms of armed manpower, missiles, drones and in the case of the Houthis, tanks. There are also the numerous deadly splinters of al-Qaeda and IS, Pakistan’s mostly Sunni (from all schools, Salafi, Barelvi, Deobandi) Lashkars and Jaish-e this or that, including Iran’s latest target, Jaish al-Adl.

It is this larger group, comprising both the states and the non-state actors who are governed in the name of Islam and exert pan-national influence, that we define as the world of political Islam.

This power has challenged and destabilised the world as never before in its history. There was the oil shock after the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the two Gulf Wars, 9/11, al-Qaeda, IS and the many Intifadas. Each was limited in its geographical spread, strategic reach and intensity of violence. Today’s disruption is worldwide.

The unlikely rise of sanctions-hit Iran as a regional and sectarian power is a key point. Its influence now goes way beyond the Middle East, as even the Russians court it desperately for shipments of its drones, ammunition and cheap missiles. Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are its state-sized proxies.

Iran is rising mostly because this world of political Islam had been leaderless and powerless for decades. The 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda and IS, weakened it as these gave America a strategic and moral justification to move in militarily.

In their respective heydays, both al-Qaeda and IS attempted to wrest this leadership and failed. The Arab Spring, initially welcomed and backed by the Western powers and liberal establishment, rose in this continuing maelstrom.

The idea of a move away from dictatorship to elected democracy was heady. But as the Muslim Brotherhood or some equivalent was elected in one country after another, the Western-liberal enthusiasm vaporised. The upshot is the ‘welcome’ return of dictatorship and the old normal in Egypt and almost in Tunisia, the broken nation-states of Syria and Libya and the flood of refugees to Europe.

In parallel, a great deal of such destabilisation took place in Africa as well. The Western power was now so overstretched and exhausted that Barack Obama, after killing Gaddafi, breaking Libya and more, was talking of leading from behind.

All of this created a great vacuum of state, strategic and moral authority. Iran moved into it. Its non-state proxies are bigger than the armies of most of the other nations in this grouping of political Islam.

We are all familiar with that slogan ‘from the river to the sea’ that so energises the Palestinians and enrages the Israelis. For today’s geopolitics, it will need to be something like ‘from the Mediterranean to the Arabian Sea through the Red Sea…’ and so on.

The hard fact is that today, all of the American-led Western powers, with varying support from friends including India, are not able to keep their most critical sea lanes free. This, when their pretence is keeping the Indo-Pacific and South China Sea free. This rise of diverse but aligned Islamist challenges has exposed the limitations of big-power militaries.

Other powers are rising too. Qatar is the pre-eminent one, forever the ‘swing’ state, pretending to dispense favours to this and that but acting mostly on its own.

It is a remarkable entity in that it is that indispensable state for the US, Iran, Hamas and the Israelis at the same time. Egypt’s Sisi has found new ballast too, making top American diplomats wait (without him, the Rafah crossing from Gaza won’t open) and winning what he called an election, without a whimper from Washington.

All of this adds up to the strongest challenge to the Western power since the end of the Cold War.

Then how do we build the counter-argument that this world of political Islam is at its weakest ever? First, however long this fighting and disruption goes on, it will eventually end and the ‘Islamist’ group will not win. Disruptive firepower apart, it simply does not have the cohesion to win.

Once we rule out a win by Iran and its proxies, only the Gulf states and Turkey remain in this particular Islamic world. They’re weaker than before, unable to choose sides with clarity over Gaza and attacked as American lackeys.

Erdoğan has repositioned Turkey as a deal-maker and a deal-broker, in eastern Europe more than Asia, like a mega Qatar with no oil or gas. That he now searches for influence in the Indian Subcontinent underlines the limitations to his ambitions.

Therefore, the real unwinnable wars in this universe are between its own Islamic states. The Iran-Pakistan fireworks are only the latest spectacle.

After Zia, democracy had given Pakistan — with a small but modern, educated elite — the choice of breaking away from his Islamisation and rebranding itself like Indonesia, or learning from Bangladesh. It’s built its own unique hybrid — but essentially Islamised — state. Count it among the losers in this ongoing tussle for global influence.

And finally, a category we do not talk about enough. Most of the world’s Muslims living in permanent peace belong to nations outside this grouping: Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and India. Islam is the state religion in the first two, but they eschew militant pan-Islamism. Muslims in these and other such states add up to nearly a billion. These Muslim communities are winners too, and without fighting anybody. Maldives has just become an exception in this group, choosing full Islamisation.

These nations’ blessing is the relative non-politicisation of their faith. Therein lies a larger warning to all nations: that moulding their state and nationalism around a religion is bound to fail. It’s also the lesson of the past many centuries.

That’s why it is such an incredible irony that — while it didn’t bat an eyelid over Egypt, loves the dictators of the Gulf and cheers on the Pakistani army as it fixes its election — the only thing giving Washington a stomach ache is an imperfect election in Bangladesh. Which, by the way, does not proclaim itself an Islamic Republic despite a Muslim majority of over 90 percent.

Starting the day at 86 for 2, Delhi batters could only survive a total of 67.5 overs but in the process managed to cross MP’s first innings total of 171.

Indore, Jan 20 (PTI) Delhi batters once again floundered on a reasonably decent batting strip to be bowled out for 205 as Madhya Pradesh nullified the slender first innings lead of 34 with better batting effort in the second innings on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Group D encounter.

At stumps on Day 2, MP are 157 for 5 with an overall lead of 123 but with skipper and batting mainstay Shubham Sharma (79) back in the dug-out, the two new ball bowlers Himanshu Chauhan (2/31 in 10 overs) and Divij Mehra (2/41 in 11.1 overs) need to wrap it up quickly on third morning.

The problem for Delhi is their restrictive option Vikas Mishra, the left arm spinner, who has already gone for 40 in just 8 overs.

In the morning, MP pacers Aryan Pandey (3/54 in 18 overs) and Anubhav Agarwal (2/42 in 18 overs).

Once skipper Himmat Singh (25) was trapped leg before by Pandey and Dhull (47) failed to read away movement generated by Agarwal, none of the Delhi batters showed temperament to stick around and take the total past 250-run mark.

Ayush Badoni scored 41 and seemed he was playing for Lucknow Super Giants and just wanted to hit out of trouble rather than displaying application required to succeed in red ball games.

The last four wickets fell for 16 runs as Kumar Kartikeya quickly wrapped off the tail.

Brief Scores: MP 171 and 157/5 (Shubham Sharma 79, Aryan Pandey 3/54). Delhi 205 (Yash Dhull 47, Ayush Badoni 41, Aryan Pandey 3/54).

Puducherry lead by 151 runs ================= Gourav Yadav continued his good form with a six-wicket haul as Puducherry dismissed Uttarakhand for a paltry 123 on the second day of their group league match in Dehradun.

Having scored 204 in their first innings, Puducherry pacer Gourav, who took 10 wickets against Delhi, scalped 6 for 40 while spinner Sagar Udeshi got the other four as the hosts batted a little over 47 overs.

With 81-run first innings lead, Puducherry ended the second day at 70 for 3 with an overall lead of 151.

Brief Scores: Puducherry 204 and 70/3. Uttarakhand 123 (Aditya Tare 40, Gourav Yadav 6/40).

Baroda go for kill against HP ================== Baroda managed a commendable first innings score of 482 riding on a 345-run fifth wicket stand between Shaswat Rawat (207) and Shivalik Sharma (188) before reducing hosts Himachal Pradesh to 143 for 8 by the end of the second day’s play in Dharamsala.

Baroda are all set to take first innings lead but have enough time to enforce follow-on and try for bonus point.

Brief Scores: Baroda 482 (Shaswat Rawat 207, Shivalik Sharma 188, Vaibhav Arora 5/68). HP 143/8 (Atit Seth 3/43, Abhimanyusingh Rajput 4/39).

J&K close in on win ============ Jammu and Kashmir earned a vital first innings lead of 50 and then reduced Odisha to 126 for 7 in their second innings to close in on an outright victory at stumps on the second day in Cuttack.

Odisha are only 76 ahead with three wickets in hand.

In first innings, Odisha scored 130 while Jammu & Kashmir riding on Abid Mushtaq’s 50 scored 180 in their first essay.

Brief Scores: Odisha 130 and 126/7 (Rohit Sharma Junior 2/23).

Jammu and Kashmir 180 (Abid Mushtaq 50). PTI KHS KHS KHS

The administration of Union Territory of Lakdakh has taken an initiative to operate subsidised plane and helicopter service from Ladakh during winters, when roads in the entire region remain cut off from the rest of the country.

Kargil/Jammu, Jan 20 (PTI) The air courier service from Kargil to Jammu will resume its operations from January 22 to facilitate movement of people during the winter months.

“The first flight of Kargil courier service is scheduled on January 22 from Kargil to Jammu and from Jammu to Kargil, subject to fair weather,” a senior official said.

“Passengers may book their online tickets, from the comfort of their homes, through online mode”, he said.

Ladakh remains closed for more than 7 months and during winters, roads in the entire region remain cut off from the rest of the country, prompting administration to start plane and heli services in the region.

The helicopter service will cater passengers from far-flung areas of Ladakh on approved routes from Leh-Lingshed, Dibling, Drass, Padum, Kargil,Nubra and Nerak, the official said. PTI AB NB

India boast of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav.

The first Test begins in Hyderabad on Thursday. England decided to prepare for the tour in Abu Dhabi rather than playing a tour game in India.

London, Jan 21 (PTI) Former England captain Michael Atherton reckons India’s superior spin attack will win them the five-Test home series against Ben Stokes and Co.

“I think India will win. Their spinners are better than England’s and that will be the defining thing in the end,” Atherton told Skysports.

England last won a series in India back in 2012 when Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar outbowled their Indian counterparts.

“If you go to India, spin will play a big part, it historically has done and I suspect it always will do. India do have a very strong seam attack as well,” said Atherton.

“India’s four spinners are very different to England’s. They have two left-arm finger spinners in Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. They have a wrist spinner in Kuldeep Yadav and Ravichandran Ashwin is one of the greatest spinners of all time.

“England have a solid left-arm spinner in Jack Leach and then three very inexperienced spinners after that with Tom Hartley, Shoaib Bashir and Rehan Ahmed.

“It will be a particular challenge for them but the selectors see a high ceiling for them,” he added.

The pitches are expected to turn from day one in India, providing a massive test also for the England batters. PTI BS TAP

He completed normal concussion assessments today,” the team said in a statement.

The 37-year-old batsman retired hurt on Friday in the final few overs of Australia’s thumping 10-wicket victory in the first test after being struck on the helmet by a Shamar Joseph delivery.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) – Australia opener Usman Khawaja looks increasingly likely to play the second test against West Indies in Brisbane this week after completing concussion protocols on Sunday.

“Khawaja will continue to be monitored for any delayed symptoms. He will be reviewed again tomorrow prior to returning to training ahead of the second test match in Brisbane.”

Australia will have to find a new opener for the second time in the series if Khawaja is unfit to play when the day-night second test begins on Thursday.

Steve Smith moved up the order to replace David Warner when the veteran opener retired from the format in the wake of the 3-0 series sweep of Pakistan around the New Year.

Barring another positional switch, Matt Renshaw looks most likely to open in Brisbane if Khawaja misses out.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) – Taylor Fritz stormed past last year’s runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas and into the Australian Open quarter-finals for the first time after beating the Greek seventh seed 7-6(3) 5-7 6-3 6-3 at Melbourne Park on Sunday.

“I was just really trusting my shots,” the 26-year-old said in his on-court interview. “I served well the whole match. It just kept me in it and then when I really needed it at the end I just started playing my best tennis.”

Fritz’s victory came at a cost for his girlfriend Morgan Riddle, who had promised her social media followers she would eat an entire jar of Vegemite on Instagram Live if he won the match.

“My girlfriend thought I was too confident to win the match,” Fritz added when he was handed a jar of the Aussie food spread by his on-court interviewer.

“This is a big jar but a bet’s a bet. I have tried it, but I’m not the biggest fan so I won’t be partaking.

“But I’ll make sure it happens.”

He has 29 fifties and 30 centuries in 113 matches.

England’s batting lineup has embraced an ultra-aggressive style, often associated with their head coach Brendon McCullum’s approach towards the game in his playing days. “The way he’s (Virat Kohli) been batting, his movement looks good. With the form that he’s in, we have Viratball to counter Bazball,” Gavaskar told Star Sports.

New Delhi, Jan 21 (PTI) Indian great Sunil Gavaskar has backed ‘Viratball’ to counter England’s much talked about ‘Bazball’ approach in the five-Test series beginning in Hyderabad on January 25.

“Yeah, conversion means having more hundreds than fifties. With Kohli, he has as a similar amount of hundreds and fifties, that means he has a good conversion rate,” Gavaskar said.

England drew their previous series against India at home. However hosts India, unbeaten in a Test series since their 1-2 los to England in 2012-2013 season, remain a formidable opponent.

The Test series promises an intriguing clash between India’s spin prowess, led by experienced campaigners like Ravichandran Ashwin, and England’s aggressive batting strategy. India also have the likes of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel.

“England have adopted a new approach in Test cricket in the last 1-2 years. It’s an aggressive approach where batters look to attack. They just want to play attacking cricket no matter the situation. It’ll be interesting to see if this approach works against the spinners of India,” Gavaskar added. PTI TAP BS BS

In a letter to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi during his Arunachal leg of ‘Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra’ here on Saturday, the women’s body emphasised on the adverse impact of polygamous practices on the state’s social fabric, highlighting the exploitation of women and the degradation of gender equality.

Itanagar, Jan 21 (PTI) The Arunachal Pradesh Women’s Welfare Society (APWWS) has expressed deep concern about the “surge in polygamous practices” in the state.

The women’s body in its letter highlighted a key point of contention regarding the withdrawal of the Arunachal Pradesh Monogamy Election Bill 2023 from the Assembly proceedings on September 6, last year.

“The bill, introduced by Congress MLA Ninong Ering aimed to make individuals with only one spouse eligible to run for elections. It sought crucial amendments to the Representation of People’s Act, 1951, as well as the inclusion of the Panchayat Act, 1997, and the Municipal Act, 2007,” the APWWS said in the letter.

The APWWS pleaded with Gandhi to consider addressing polygamy-related issues under his leadership within the Congress party.

It also urged active support for the eligibility of individuals with one spouse to run for elections as a significant step towards empowering and improving the status of women in Arunachal Pradesh. PTI UPL RG

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – Two people were killed and four were injured when fire engulfed a residential building in Johannesburg early on Sunday, city officials said, adding search and rescue operations were still underway.

An investigation into the cause of the fire will be undertaken once firefighting operations have been completed, officials said.

More than 70 people died last August after a fire raged through a run-down, five-storey Johannesburg apartment block, in one of the worst such disasters in a city where poverty, household fires and homelessness are widespread.

An inquiry to determine responsibility for that blaze is ongoing, but the incident highlighted a longstanding housing crisis that has seen some buildings in the inner city of Johannesburg occupied illegally.

The government, home minister Amit Shah said , is also considering ending the Free Movement Regime instituted in 2018, which allows members of hill tribes to cross the border with a pass.

Like some malign god, Border Pillar 78 manifested itself one morning. No one can exactly remember handing the lush green lands and one gate of the Sri Angala Parameshwari Sri Muneeswarar temple to Burma. The earlier pillar, the local Tamil community insisted , had been sited some eighty metres to the east. The Tamils had been compelled to hand over an older temple to Burma, after the demarcation of the border in 1964. This time, armed with land records, the community demanded that work to fence the border come to an end.

The shuttering down of the border, an admission that India’s so-called Look East policy is floundering, comes amid rising violence. Forces operating around the border town of Moreh, where ethnic Meitei have been driven from their homes and lands, have come under sustained fire on multiple occasions, leading to police fatalities. The state government claims ethnic Kuki insurgents housed in bases across the border are responsible for the violence.

Delhi’s security concerns

From New Delhi’s point of view, the case for closing the border is a strong one. Insurgents fighting the military regime in Myanmar have overrun key positions along the border. Khampat, a key town just south of Moreh, fell late last year, allowing insurgents to choke traffic from Mandalay along the ambitious India-funded Asian Highway 1. The insurgents earlier took control of Rikhawdar, sited across the border from Zokhawthar in Mizoram, the only other legal trading post.

India’s junta-obsessed policies in Myanmar rested on the assumption the military was a partner of necessity to fight insurgency and narcotics trafficking. Now, New Delhi is confronted with the real prospect insurgents might be able to operate from safe havens located across the border from Nagaland to Mizoram and Manipur.

Few experts, though, say ending the Free Movement Regime will help the situation. Fencing even a small part of the border—much of it mountainous, punctuated by dense forest—will take years, and monitoring professional weapons and narcotics traffickers through the jungle terrain will be challenging, even advocates concede. The violence in Manipur, moreover, is driven by the deep ethnic divisions nursed by Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren Singh, and has little to do with transborder tensions.

The emphasis on hardening the border might, instead, only serve to create bitterness among hill communities like the Mizo and Kuki, who see their relationships with kin in Myanmar as key to their identity.

Lalduhoma, Mizoram’s chief minister, has said the state government has no power to stop fencing work, but noted that the Mizo do not accept the borders imposed by the British. Exactly that claim gave birth to a savage insurgency which climaxed, in 1966, with air strikes on Aizawl, and a brutal military campaign which included the forced internment of large sections of the population, the burning down of villages, and mass rape.

Looking East

For centuries before diplomats began using the term, Indians and other Asians were Looking East. The kings of the great central Thai city of Ayutthaya—which in the sixteenth century, historians Raymond Scupin and Christopher Joll remind us, had a population of 300,000, more than contemporary London—observed Theravada Buddhism, as well as Hinduism, inherited from the Khmer. They also patronised the mosques and festivals of their Shi’a Persian expatriate merchants, as well as Malays and Cham Muslims from Cambodia.

European records from 1683, scholar M Ismail Marcinkowski notes, reveal an Ambassador from Ayutthaya arriving in Persia, with “extremely precious gifts, among them golden vessels, Chinese porcelain, and Japanese lacquer work and furthermore rare birds of all kinds.”

The regime of General Phibunsongkhram, who ruled from 1938-1944, introduced a fascist-inspired ethno-nationalism and tried to stamp out this diversity. Yet, descendants of the Ayutthaya Persians can still be found in Khlong Bangkok-Noi and Khlong Bangkok-Yai in Bangkok’s Thonburi. Gujarati and Bengali speakers, Tamils, and Pashtun all have communities in the city.

Large numbers of Sikhs, researcher Swarn Singh Kahlon has written, also established communities stretching from Burma to Thailand and Singapore. Although some Sikhs arrived in the region serving as police and military personnel, others were traders.

Even though migration from India to East Asia diminished after 1947, many communities maintained their presence. Tamils were evacuated from Burma in large numbers ahead of advancing Imperial Japanese troops in 1941, anthropologist Stephanie Ramamurthy recorded. The Tamil enclave at Moreh was first established by refugees who made the tough hike across the hills. Even though some Tamils returned to Burma, the large-scale nationalisation programme of military ruler General Ne Win led to a second exodus in 1962.

The problem of trafficking and criminality, built around the implosion of state authority in parts of East Asia, isn’t just an Indian one. Entire cities have emerged built around cyber-scams and gambling, like the notorious Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Laos. From being the economic powerhouse some had imagined, the route from Thailand to India’s Northeast funnels heroin and weapons.

From the time of Ayutthaya to the British Empire, though, South East Asia was also home to multi-ethnic trade networks of a very different kind. It’s around that ideal that the Look East policy was built—and India shouldn’t be giving up just yet.

The China challenge

Among the countries that aren’t giving up on the region is China. Instead of spending its resources building easy-to-bypass fences, China has renewed plans to build a railway that connects its southern province of Yunnan with Mandalay—thus giving the superpower reliable access to an Indian Ocean port. There is also a railroad snaking through Laos into Thailand, and a growing network of gas pipelines. Where India gambled all on the junta ruling Burma, China proved adroit at cultivating both the generals and insurgent groups.

The real question for India is why it has allowed politics to mire strategically important states like Manipur in ethnic conflict, sabotaging its hopes of completing Asian Highway 1 from Moreh and building connectivity with countries like Thailand.

Even if the Generals in Burma remain in office, it’s certain a long war lies ahead. The junta is reported to have sacked five of six Brigadiers responsible for its defeats in Kokang, along the border with China; to the west, growing numbers of regime soldiers are fleeing into India.

Like the Sri Angala Parameshwari temple, India needs to find a way to keep one gate open into Myanmar, even as the crisis unfolds.

Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions which Russia claimed to have annexed last year in a move condemned as illegal by most countries at the United Nations General Assembly. It does not fully control any of the four regions.

By Shrivathsa Sridhar MELBOURNE (Reuters) – Stefanos Tsitsipas said he hoped to emerge stronger from his fourth-round defeat by Taylor Fritz at the Australian Open on Sunday after the Greek world number seven suffered his earliest exit in four years at the Melbourne Park Grand Slam.

“It’s not a negative feeling,” he told reporters. “It’s a feeling of evolution, of change, which is constant. Change is always constant. One day you’re in the top 10, the other day you’re not there anymore.

“So you have to keep on working and allowing yourself to flourish through these experiences, allow yourself to seek for all these moments that have been working for you over the last few years, give it another shot time after time.”

Tsitsipas, who is yet to win a Grand Slam, said dealing with setbacks was part of the job.

“There’s way more moments in your career that are painful and tough to deal with, suffering and all that, than moments of glory and success and opening champagne bottles,” he added.

“These are a small percentage of what a tennis player lives on a yearly basis.”

Six deaths– four from Kerala and one each from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh — have been reported in a span of 24 hours, according to the ministry’s data updated at 8 am.

New Delhi, Jan 21 (PTI) India has logged 290 fresh cases of Covid, while the number of active cases of the infection has been recorded at 2,059, the health ministry said on Sunday.

A single day rise of 841 new cases were reported on December 31, 2023 which is 0.2 per cent of the peak cases reported in May 2021, official sources said.

Of the total active cases, a large majority of these (around 92 per cent) are recovering under home isolation.

“The currently available data suggests that the JN.1 variant is neither leading to an exponential rise in new cases nor a surge in hospitalisation and mortality,” the sources stated.

India has witnessed three waves of COVID-19 in the past with the peak incidence of daily new cases and deaths being reported in the Delta wave during April-June 2021.

At its peak, 4,14,188 new cases and 3,915 deaths were reported on May 7, 2021.

Since the pandemic began in early 2020, more than 4.5 crore people have got infected and over 5.3 lakh people have died across the country due to the infection.

The number of people who have recuperated from the disease stands at over 4.4 crore with a national recovery rate of 98.81 per cent, according to the ministry’s website.

According to the website, 220.67 crore doses of Covid vaccines have so far been administered in the country. PTI PLB DV DV

St Petersburg [Russia], January 21 (ANI): A fire broke out at Russian independent natural gas producer Novatek’s terminal in the port of Ust-Luga in the Leningrad Region, TASS reported citing the region’s governor, on Sunday.

The governor also said that the Russian Emergencies Ministry and local firefighting units were at the scene to douse the fire, as reported by TASS.

The Marine Traffic website previously noted the presence of up to five fuel tankers, displaying flags from Panama, Gabon, Liberia, and Greece, anchored near the Ust-Luga port.

Novatek’s official website provided insights into the Ust-Luga Complex, emphasising its role as a gas condensate fractionation and transhipment facility situated at the all-season port of Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea.

The complex, operational since 2013, processes stable gas condensate to produce light and heavy naphtha, jet fuel, ship fuel components (fuel oil), and gasoil. Additionally, it facilitates the transportation of these value-added petroleum products to international markets.

The Ust-Luga Complex boasts the capacity to transship stable gas condensate to export markets, with an initial capacity of 6 million tonnes that increased to 7 million tonnes per year after the launch of a new plant.

The incident prompted a coordinated response from local and national authorities to address the fire swiftly and minimise potential environmental and operational repercussions, TASS reported. (ANI)

The air gun surrender campaign is an initiative of the state’s Environment and Forest department to dissuade wildlife hunting and create awareness of the ill effects of killing wildlife.

Itanagar, Jan 21 (PTI) As many as 38 people surrendered their air guns during an event organised at Tezu, the district headquarters town of Lohit district in Arunachal Pradesh.

Natung also voiced concern over the rapid decline of wildlife due to unchecked hunting, urging active public participation and awareness campaigns to instil the idea of biodiversity protection.

The initiative got a major boost when it featured in the 84th edition of the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 26, 2021, where the PM appreciated the effort of the state government.

The airgun surrender initiative had garnered international recognition, with UNESCO recently acknowledging the efforts of the Arunachal Pradesh government in the conservation of wildlife.

Under this initiative, people were invited to voluntarily surrender their air guns and licensed guns to stop the use of these guns to kill birds and other wild animals.

The programme was officially launched on March 17, 2021, at Lumdung in East Kameng district wherein 46 air guns were surrendered and Lumdung was declared the first air gun-free village of the state.

The plane was a charter ambulance flight travelling from Thailand’s Utapao Airport in Pattaya to Moscow via India and Uzbekistan on a French-made Dassault Aviation Falcon 10 jet manufactured in 1978, Russian aviation authorities said in a statement.

Kabul/ Moscow: A Russian-registered charter plane with six people on board disappeared from radar screens over Afghanistan a day earlier, Russian aviation authorities said on Sunday, after Afghan police said they had received reports of a crash.

The pilot then reported that one engine had stopped, and then that the second one had also stopped, SHOT reported.

Reuters could not immediately confirm the details shared by SHOT.

India’s civil aviation authority said the plane was not a scheduled commercial flight or an Indian chartered aircraft and that it awaited more details.

The flight was carrying out a private medical evacuation from Thailand’s Pattaya, a popular tourist destination for Russians, to Moscow, Russian state-run TASS news agency reported, citing the Russian embassy in Bangkok.

“On board was a bedridden patient in serious condition, a Russian citizen, who was transported from one of the hospitals in Pattaya to Russia,” the RIA news agency reported, citing a source at Thailand’s Utapao International Airport.

“She was accompanied by her husband, a private entrepreneur, also a Russian citizen, who paid for the flight.”

Several Russian media outlets said the passengers were a couple from Volgodonsk in southern Russia.

A manifest list for the plane, published by the SHOT news outlet, appeared to show the crew were Russian nationals, too.

Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal case to determine if safety rules had been violated.

The plane’s reported owner, a small Russian firm called Athletic Group LLC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Taliban-run Afghan aviation ministry said in a statement on X that the plane’s planned route did not include passing through Afghanistan’s air space and that “probably due to technical issues” the plane had diverted from its planned route.

The statement said a ministry technical team was investigating the matter.

Afghanistan police had received reports of a plane crash in a remote, mountainous region of Badakhshan in Afghanistan’s far north, a provincial police spokesperson said on Sunday.

Zabihullah Amiri, a spokesperson for Badakhshan’s provincial government, told Reuters a team had been sent to the location of the crash, a remote area more than 200 km (124 miles) from the provincial capital Fayzabad that would take the team 12 hours to reach.

Moscow says its forces have regained the initiative in many areas after a failed Ukrainian counter-offensive last year against Russia’s 2022 invasion.

The small advance follows a similar statement on Thursday from the defence ministry saying its forces had taken control of a settlement named Vesele in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.

(Reuters) -Russian forces have taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, Russia’s Defence Ministry said on Sunday, and a Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed that Kyiv’s forces had withdrawn.

Ukrainian military spokesperson Volodymyr Fitio played down the latest news and told national television that Russia’s capture of Krokhmalne had no impact on the overall situation.

“Our main goal is to save the lives of our defenders and they were moved to pre-prepared positions where they are now holding defences to prevent the enemy from advancing further,” Fitio said.

He said Krokhmalne had five houses and before the war was home to only 45 people. The “several hundred metres” captured by Russian troops were of no consequence, he said, calling the event a “temporary phenomenon”.

The Middle East is a tinder-box, we must do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region.”

“Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary-general,” Guterres said at the opening of a summit of the G77+China in the Ugandan capital Kampala.

By Elias Biryabarema KAMPALA (Reuters) – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Sunday denounced Israel for the “heartbreaking” deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and called it unacceptable to resist statehood for the Palestinian people.

Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Islamist militant group Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which Israeli officials say more than 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and 240 taken hostage.

Israel’s campaign has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities on Sunday, and displaced most of the enclave’s 2.3 million people from their homes.

Over the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.

Guterres added that the refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians is totally unacceptable, saying denying Palestinians the right to statehood “would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security”.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on Saturday to push back against U.S. President Joe Biden’s remarks about Palestinian statehood after the war against Hamas ends. His office said that in talks on Friday with Biden, Netanyahu “reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.

Guterres was in Kampala to attend the summits of G77+China and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Leaders and senior officials from dozens of countries including South Africa, Iran, China, Turkey, Cuba, India, Vietnam and others attended the meetings.

The G77+China is a group of 134 developing countries that champions the common interests of countries from the global south.

A document released late Saturday at the end of the NAM summit included a condemnation of “the illegal Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip, the indiscriminate attacks against Palestinian civilians, civilian objects, the forced displacement of the Palestinian population” and called for an immediate and durable humanitarian ceasefire.

(Reuters) -Eighteen people were killed and 13 injured after Ukrainian forces shelled the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Alexei Kulemzin, the city’s Russian-installed mayor, said on Sunday.

Reuters photographs taken at the scene showed crying people and bodies lying on a snow-covered street near one of the city’s markets.

Pushilin said emergency services were working at the scene and that forensic specialists were trying to collect fragments of the weapons used in the attack.

Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions which Russia claimed to have annexed last year in a move condemned as illegal by most countries at the United Nations General Assembly. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.

After 15 months, I am still waiting for the amount to be disbursed. My wife had to sell her jewellery to pay back the loan,” Junaid told PTI.

Junaid is among the 103 scholars pursuing research in universities in the national capital under the fellowship grant from MANF meant for minority students. Many of these students are facing difficulties in managing monthly expenses due to this delay.

New Delhi, Jan 21 (PTI) Junaid (named changed), a PhD scholar in Jamia Millia Islamia, was forced to sell his wife’s gold to pay his house rent since the stipend of Maulana Azad National Fellowship (MANF) was pending for over a year that pushed him into a debt trap.

His stipend has not come since November 2022. Being the eldest child of a single mother, he is juggling between family responsibilities and his dream to pursue research.

Abdul Nasir, who is a beneficiary of the last batch of MANF at Delhi University (2022-27), continues to battle with irregular stipends even after winning a case in the Delhi High Court.

The first-generation scholar from a farmers’ family, Nasir had moved the court over the grant of fellowship to a candidate who scored fewer marks than him. The court in May 2022 ruled in his favour.

He had to shift to a paying guest facility and send his spouse back to his hometown in Bihar to cut down on expenses.

“Despite the ruling, I have not received nearly four months’ stipend pending since September 2023 and HRA for the last one year. I am burdened with debt because of the delay in the disbursement of fellowship,” he said.

MANF provides financial assistance to research scholars from minority communities which include Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsi and Muslims.

The fellowship was discontinued by the Centre in December 2022 stating that it overlaps with other similar schemes. However, the existing beneficiaries of the scheme till February 2022 are supposed to get the stipend amount for five years under the fellowship.

The MANF Junior Research Fellows (JRF) get Rs 31,000 per month and Senior Research Fellows (SRF) Rs 35,000 per month. JRF and SRF stipends were last revised in 2019.

The amount should have been revised to Rs 37,000 and Rs 42,000, respectively as per the UGC hike implemented across other fellowships for higher education, the scholars said.

In a letter to Union Minister for Minority Affairs Smriti Irani, Lok Sabha member TN Prathapan requested to hike the MANF fellowship and disburse the stipend without delay.

“It has come to my notice that many fellowships such as UGC, JRF, NFOBC and NFST/SC have witnessed an increase in financial allocations. The Maulana Azad National Fellowship seems to have been overlooked in this regard,” the letter dated December 23 said, urging her to take necessary action.

An email sent to the Ministry of Minority Affairs and National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC), the body responsible for the release of the MANF funds, did not elicit a response.

Scholars from 30 universities across the country also claimed to have written to the Minority Affairs Ministry — the nodal agency for distribution of MANF and NMDFC – requesting to increase the fellowship amount and disburse it timely on a monthly basis.

The president of NSUI in Jamia Millia Islamia, NS Abdul Hameed, said he was forced to extend his PhD degree by two years because of a dearth of money. Due to the delay in payment of the scholarship, he is not able to concentrate on his studies. His studies have also suffered because he is finding it difficult to carry out fieldwork and arrange for books.

Sajid Imaandar is another MANF beneficiary at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) struggling to make ends meet while keeping his passion for research alive. He has four months of mess fees pending because of irregular disbursement of stipend.

The scholars said they are caught in a debt trap as they are forced to manage their daily expenses by borrowing money from friends.

Worries of passing another month trouble these students.

Delhi has a total of 103 MANF beneficiaries across the central universities, according to the government data presented in Parliament. The figure is around 1,500 across the country.

Many of these students complain that the fellowship amount has increased for all other scholarships, except theirs. This has impacted them and they feel demotivated, they said. PTI SJJ KSS KSS NSD NSD

The leopard was spotted by a hawker selling newspapers around 7 am in Rishi Nagar. Later, the leopard was seen in CCTV footage of the area, they said.

Hisar, Jan 21 (PTI) A leopard entered a residential area in Hisar on Sunday and injured two persons before it was captured after a multi-agency seven-hour rescue effort, officials said.

It remained unclear from how the leopard entered the city and made its way into the residential area.

The rescue team’s guard Manjeet and another employee Bablu were injured in an attack by the leopard when the team attempted to catch the animal from a warehouse, officials said.

The leopard jumped over a wall in the warehouse and attacked a woman on the street outside but she narrowly escaped, they said.

Hearing the noise of the crowd gathered there, the leopard then entered a house. Police said that the administration also arranged a trap to catch the leopard but when it was not successful, it was hit with a tranquiliser dart.

Islamabad [Pakistan], January 21 (ANI): Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has sought a level playing field for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the run-up to general elections and warned that lack of transparency in elections would cause more “instability,” Pakistan-based Dawn reported.

Speaking about the crackdown on PTI, Imran Khan said the establishment could not “dismantle the party since it has roots in the masses.” He warned ‘turncoats’ that their politics would end if they left PTI, according to Dawn report.

The cricketer-turned-politician accused the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of deliberately delaying the matter related to the PTI’s intra-party elections to take “stern and sudden action” to deprive the political party of its electoral symbol.

Highlighting the efforts of Pakistan’s President to bring down the political temperature, Khan said Arif Alvi tried to mediate but to no avail. Expressing his views about Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, Imran Khan said that Pakistan would suffer “irreparable loss” if attempts were made to impose an “absconder” on Pakistan.

PTI founder said that Nawaz Sharif cancelled his rally in Layyah as PML-N did not have the strength to organise a power show. He claimed that the PTI will hold the ‘biggest ever’ gathering even if he is released from jail only a couple of days before the polls.

Speaking about his cases in courts, Imran Khan said that despite the disposal of his plea by the Lahore High Court regarding the rejection of nomination papers, the order in this regard was not released, Dawn reported.

He said that his plea against disqualification was not being heard and added that Nawaz Sharif had been given a clean chit by the courts and allowed to contest polls. PTI founder said that another petition he registered against violations of human rights was also pending before the Supreme Court for a long time.

Imran Khan said there was no rule of law in Pakistan. However, he added that he would not take the law into his own hands as a politician and would “play till the last ball.”

Meanwhile, the internet services in Pakistan were interrupted at about 7 pm (local time), an hour prior to the “virtual power show” of the PTI broadcast on social media websites, especially YouTube.

In a post shared on X, Global Internet Monitor Netblocks stated that live metrics showcase “a nation-scale disruption to social media platforms across Pakistan, including X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube,” Dawn reported.

Taking to X, Netblocks stated, “The incident comes as persecuted opposition leader Imran Khan’s political party, PTI, launches its second virtual gathering.”

With regards to these blackouts, some internet service providers (ISPs) informed their customers that they might face internet issues due to a “degradation” in their network.

An Islamabad-based ISP said in a message, “Our teams are already working for the earliest resolution. Inconvenience is regretted,” Dawn reported.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has, however, connected these disruptions to its virtual event. PTI spokesperson Raoof Hassan said, “Shame on the caretakers that are causing damage to Pakistanis only, and this was the proof of what they intend to do on February 8, but the people are aware of all such moves.” (ANI)

The yatra commenced from Manipur on January 14 and will culminate in Mumbai on March 20.

People’s support for the yatra has ‘rattled’ the CM, who ‘loses his mental balance’ at the mention of Congress and Rahul Gandhi, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed.

Biswanath Chariali (Assam), Jan 21 (PTI) The Congress has again alleged that the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led Assam government has been creating hurdles for the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra ‘every hour’ as it entered its fourth day in the state on Sunday.

Addressing a press conference here, Ramesh, who is accompanying Gandhi, said, “The problem is that the CM here loses his mental balance whenever he hears the name of Congress and Rahul Gandhi. What more can I say about it.” He claimed that Sarma was ‘rattled’ from the first day of the yatra in the state after women, who had purportedly gathered at a government function, came forward to welcome Gandhi and clicked photos with him.

“Since then, he has been agitated and rattled and finds one excuse or the other to create problems. There was an FIR in Jorhat, route permission issues in Guwahati, among others,” he said.

“I have to again say, the first Bharat Jodo Yatra had travelled through four BJP-ruled states, but there were no major issues. Nowhere has the yatra been targeted by any CM as here. It is our first experience. Problems are being created every hour,” the Congress leader said.

The Nyay Yatra and its chief organiser KB Byju had been slapped with an FIR in Jorhat over alleged route deviation when the yatra passed through the town on Thursday.

In Guwahati, where the yatra is scheduled to reach on Tuesday, Congress has claimed that permission for padyatra and road show has been denied on the route and an interaction with journalists at Gauhati Press Club has also been refused.

The party claimed that it has been allowed to proceed with the yatra through a peripheral road, which acts at the national highway bypass for the main city.

“Whether at the press club or not is another matter, but Gandhi will address the national media on January 23. Even if it is at the camp site,” Ramesh said.

On being purportedly denied to visit the Gauhati Press Club, he said, “We have the copy of the invitation sent to Rahul ji. But I don’t want to put anyone in problem. I don’t want to release it now as the CM will unnecessarily go after them. He indulges in vindictive politics just like the prime minister.” Ramesh urged Sarma to ‘relax’ and let the Congress complete the yatra in a democratic manner.

“He should continue to fill his coffers. He is a ‘kuber’ (rich person) now, he will become a ‘super kuber’ by the time next elections come and then people will give their reply,” Ramesh added. PTI SSG MNB

The turnaround time from getting them assembled to ship-to-launch is about six months. That makes it 40 every year,” Awais Ahmed, founder and CEO Pixxel, told PTI.

Pixxel recently launched its satellite manufacturing unit — Mega Pixxel — in Bengaluru where it can assemble, integrate and test 40 satellites weighing 100 kilogrammes every year as the nascent company aims to take a leap in the space sector.

New Delhi, Jan 21 (PTI) Bengaluru-based space start-up Pixxel plans to launch a series of small, home-built satellites — Fireflies — from June that could have a finer look at the Earth with its five-metre resolution hyper-spectral imagery.

Ahmed said Pixxel aims to launch six 100-kilogramme satellites, named Fireflies, from June, and add another 12 next year to monitor in over 250 spectral bands at five-metre spatial resolution — the highest in commercial hyper-spectral satellites.

He said Pixxel also plans to launch six heavier satellites — Honeybees — next year to complete its constellation of 24 satellites with an ability to revisit any location on Earth within a 24-hour cycle.

At five metres, the Fireflies have better resolution than the demonstration satellites Shakuntala and Anand that Pixxel launched aboard SpaceX and PSLV rockets, respectively, in 2022, Ahmed said.

The satellite manufacturing facility in Bengaluru, inaugurated on January 15 by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman S Somanath, spans more than 30,000 square feet and comprises two modern clean rooms of ISO Class 7 and ISO Class 8 that safeguard against contaminants, which can impair satellite functionality during the assembly and integration process.

Additionally, it also houses labs for advanced camera integration, electronics research and development, and electrical assembly; along with a mechanical workshop, a mission control room, and an office space that can accommodate more than 200 employees.

“The facility enables us to assemble, manufacture and test satellites under our own roof, meaning we can control the schedule; we can iterate faster without being dependent on anyone external to do that,” Ahmed said.

“The faster we can build satellites for ourselves and some other customers of ours, the faster we can keep turning it around, that momentum will keep us moving forward. This is just about gaining more control of the supply chain, the assembly sequence and getting those satellites up there,” he said.

Pixxel raised USD 36 million in Series B funding last year from Google, Lightspeed and other investors. So far, it has raised USD 71 million since its founding in 2018.

“We are not in want of money right now. We just have to keep our heads down and execute. However, we will go in for funding post the launch of Fireflies in June,” Ahmed said.

Pixxel has clients such as the Union Ministry of Agriculture, Rio Tinto, National Reconnaissance Organisation of the US, and other global organisations.

Data from Pixxel satellites will be critical in helping global organisations closely monitor emissions, water pollution, gas leaks, oil spills, soil composition, forest biodiversity and crop health in unprecedented detail and at faster speeds.

The company also won the iDEX grant to build a satellite bus for the Indian Air Force and is also putting together a 150-kilogramme satellite for it. PTI SKU SZM

Satwik and Chirag, the Asian Games champions, lost 21-15 11-21 18-21 to Kang and Seo after the two pairs fought for 65 minutes in what was some breath-taking badminton at the KD Jadhav Indoor stadium here.

New Delhi, Jan 21 (PTI) Home favourites Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty went down in a tense final against world champions Kang Min Hyuk and Seo Sang Jae at India Open, settling for their second successive runners-up finish, here Sunday.

Satwik and Chirag always had tough matches against their Korean rivals though they boasted a 4-1 head-to-head count in five meetings coming into the match with the latest being at the Malaysia Open last week.

The Indian duo played some breath-taking rallies, displaying amazing reflexes as they kept the Korean pair under the pump with some relentless hitting in the opening game.

Chirag dazzled in the front court with some brilliant net interceptions as the duo led 11-9 and soon jumped to 19-13 after the break before pocketing the game when the Koreans netted a shot.

The Indian pair made a sloppy start in the second, falling behind 1-5 but change of pace and angled returns helped them make it 5-7 with Satwik standing tall at the front court and producing a net kill.

A couple of net errors from Chirag during flat exchanges gave the Koreans a six-point advantage.

The Koreans defended well, while India’s attack seemed to lose a bit of sting as Kang and Seo grabbed a 10-point advantage at 15-5. Kang stepped up with his serve and showed good variations. The Koreans held 10 game points and they converted in the second chance to roar back into the contest.

In the decider, the Koreans kept a high tempo with Kang flying across the front court as they lead 9-5. The Koreans didn’t allow the Indians to play their attacking game.

Another exciting rally ensued with the Indians finding the net as Kang and Seo grabbed a five-point cushion at the interval.

After the change of sides, Satwik stepped up at the front court as the momentum seemed to change in India’s favour with the Korean committing a service error and then finding the net.

The Koreans opted for low serve but Chirag was upto the task as they brought the equation down to two points at 13-15 soon. Satwik then sent one to the corners, while Chirag unleashed a smash as one point separated the two pairs at 15-16.

A superb low shot from forehand corner from Satwik was negated by Chirag’s net error. Kang then sent one down the line to put themselves two point away from the title.

Kang found the net next, while Chirag dominated a flat exchange as it was 18-19. The Koreans grabbed two championships point when Satwik sent one wide.

It was all over when Chirag sent one to the net and fell on the floor.

Tel Aviv [Israel], January 21 (ANI): The Israeli Navy struck a building in the central Gaza Strip where a number of Hamas terrorists were preparing to ambush soldiers, The Times of Israel reported, citing Israeli military.

In southern Gaza, the IDF said that the Air Force and snipers of the Command in a joint operation, killed numerous Hamas terrorists. In the Daraj and Tuffah areas of Gaza, the IDF said that the 401st Armoured Brigade fought against Hamas terrorists, killing some 15, and raiding a building used by the terror group, where soldiers found weapons.

Meanwhile, the IDF has released a video showing the tunnel’s inner part in Gaza’s Khan Younis, where Israeli hostages are being held by Hamas, according to The Times of Israel report.

The loss to MP will hurt Delhi more as they had put themselves in a strong position by bowling out the hosts for 171 on the opening day.

Indore, Jan 21 (PTI) A clueless Delhi suffered another embarrassing defeat in Ranji Trophy, their second in three games this season, with an 86-run loss to Madhya Pradesh in their Elite Group D match here on Sunday.

Delhi’s batters looked ill-equipped even on decent batting conditions and were bowled out for 131 after the umpires extended play beyond regulation close of play.

Vaibhav Kandpal (49 not out off 125) was the only one who could apply himself and eventually ran out of partners as Delhi were bowled out in 53.5 overs.

Delhi had lost to Puducherry in their Ranji opener before sharing a point with Jammu in a game marred by bad light. The season seems to be getting from bad to worse for the struggling outfit.

A change in captaincy after the loss to Puducherry has not been able to transform the fortunes of the team.

The batters have let the team down, starting from U-19 World Cup wining skipper Yash Dhull, who scored 33 off 46 balls on Sunday. His opening partner Salil Malhotra lasted only three balls.

For MP, the star of their second innings was skipper Shubham Sharma whose 73 off 74 balls in the second innings made all the difference.

It was an all-round effort with the ball as MP’s Anubhav Agarwal, Kulwant Khejroliya, Saransh Jain took two wickets each.

Brief Scores: At Indore: MP 171 and 251 in 78.1 overs (Shubham Sharma 73; Himanshu Chauhan 4/69). Delhi 205 and 131 all out in 53.5 overs (Yash Dhull 33, Vaibhav Kandpal 49 not out; Kulwant Khejroliya 2/30). MP beat Delhi by 86 runs for six points.

In response to Gandhi’s allegation of unemployment in Arunachal Pradesh, Wahge said the state ranked as a top performer in developing a start-up ecosystem, and the government has been addressing the unemployment problem with priority.

Regarding the lack of development in the state under the Pema Khandu-led government, the party chief claimed that the road sector has witnessed massive progress, which the successive Congress governments failed to provide.

Wahge further added that the BJP government in the state is not imposing Hindi language as alleged by the Congress leader. “Hindi is a medium of communication between the various ethnic tribes of the state with different dialects,” he added. PTI UPL UPL MNB

He said he is attending the consecration event to propagate and promote Donyi-Poloism in other parts of the country.

Ori said three to four priests from the state are attending the event and all of them are staying with the karsevaks.

Niglar, who is also the chairman of Sadbhaav Arunachal, a social organisation, informed that his NGO had launched the Ram Jyoti vitaran abhiyan (distribution of lamps) on Saturday in the state capital and is contemplating to distribute around 10,800 diyas (lamps) to the people of the state capital by Sunday evening.

AYODHYA, India (Reuters) – A grand temple to Hindu god Lord Ram opens on Monday on a site in India millions believe is his birthplace, in a religious spectacle led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi months before he seeks a rare third term in elections.

Hindu groups are portraying the inauguration ceremony in the northern city of Ayodhya as the peak of Hindu awakening after centuries of subjugation by Muslim and colonial powers.

It is also being seen as the virtual launch of the deeply religious strongman Modi’s re-election campaign for general elections due by May.

The temple site was bitterly contested for decades with both Hindus and Muslims laying claim to it and was a flashpoint for violence after a Hindu mob in 1992 destroyed a 16th century mosque which stood there.

India’s majority Hindus say the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, and was holy to them long before Muslim Mughals razed a temple at the spot and built the Babri Masjid or mosque there in 1528.

In 2019, the Supreme Court handed over the land to Hindus and ordered allotment of a separate plot to Muslims.

On Monday, Modi will take part in the culmination of rituals to inaugurate the temple, for which thousands of members of BJP and its affiliates, religious leaders and devotees from across the country are expected to gather in Ayodhya.

Some of India’s top business leaders, movie actors and sportspersons have also been invited for the consecration, organisers said.

RELIGIOUS OUTPOURING, POLITICAL CONTROVERSY

“The Lord has made me an instrument to represent all the people of India during the consecration,” Modi said on X as he began 11 days of special rituals ahead of the inauguration.

Calling it a “historic moment” when Lord Ram will take his place in his grand temple, Modi has urged Indians to light lamps in their homes and neighbourhood temples on Monday evening and once again celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights which usually falls in October-November.

“The consecration of the temple feels more like the launching of the general election campaign rather than a religious ritual,” said Prithvi Datta Chandra Shobhi, a political commentator who teaches at Krea University in southern India.

“The prime minister appears to inhabit the role of an emperor who is undertaking a major ritual sacrifice,” he said.

The temple has been built on a 2.67-acre (1.08 hectares) site inside a 70-acre (28.33 hectares) complex and only its first phase is ready. The second and final phase is expected to be completed in December 2025.

The project is estimated to cost 15 billion rupees ($181 million) and is entirely funded by donations from within the country.

India has witnessed an emotional outpouring among Hindus ahead of the consecration, with residential colonies and markets flying holy flags, organising special prayers and making plans to show the live telecast of Monday’s event on giant screens.

The inauguration has also sparked a political controversy with major opposition parties, including the main opposition Congress, declining invitations to attend saying it had been converted into a political, Modi event.

Muslim groups were not happy with the 2019 court verdict which gave the site to Hindus but said they would accept it “with humility”. Nearly five years on, they indicated they had moved on.

“The construction of the temple is going on as per the direction of the Supreme Court, so we welcome it. I don’t think there’s any feeling of ill-will in the Muslim community,” said Zufar Ahmad Faruqi, head of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation that is building a new mosque in Ayodhya about 25 km (15 miles) from the temple.

Coimbatore, Jan 21 (PTI) Skipper R Sai Kishore came up with a phenomenal bowling performance as his seven-wicket match-haul in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group C game helped Tamil Nadu trump Railways by an innings and 129 runs on the third day here on Sunday.

Maharashtra started the day from a rather stable 66 for 1 but floundered against India left-arm seamer Khaleel Ahmed who returned with impressive figures of 11-3-19-4.

Ahmed got good support from fellow left-arm pacer Aniket Chaudhary (3/32).

The home side needed to score 104 runs for a win, and they did that with ease going past the target without losing any wickets.

Openers Abhijeet Tomar (53 off 89 balls) and Yash Kothari (52 off 94 balls) guided Rajasthan home in a little over 30 overs.

At Delhi, captain Rajat Paliwal (111) and Ravi Chauhan (133 batting) made hundreds to place Services on the cusp of taking an important first innings lead over Jharkhand at the end of third day.

After bowling out their rivals for 316, Services ended the day at 315 for 3 while resuming the first innings from overnight 128 for two.

JASNA, Slovakia (Reuters) – American Mikaela Shiffrin raced to a record-extending 95th career victory when won the World Cup women’s slalom in Jasna, Slovakia on Sunday after building a big lead on her opening run.

Shiffrin’s latest victory – the American having broken Stenmark’s all-time record when she reached 87 – came a day after her main rival Petra Vlhova sustained a season-ending injury.

“I have been thinking about (Vlhova) a lot the last 24 hours,” Shiffrin said. “Honestly, this is just an enormous blow for the sport. It sucks.

“For me personally, over these years, I’ve grown to love the battles with her, and I think today she would be just so strong, so I really miss watching her ski today and having that battle.”

Vlhova tore ligaments in her right knee when she crashed during Saturday’s giant slalom. The Slovakian and Shiffrin have dominated women’s slalom for years, combining for 14 wins in the past 15 races.

Shiffrin is on pace to claim her eighth World Cup season title in slalom.

With this result, Gukesh took his tally to 4.5 points out of a possible seven and now shares the lead alongside Nodirbek Abdusattarov of Uzbekistan and overnight sole leader Anish Giri of Netherlands.

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands) Jan 21 (PTI) Indian GM D Gukesh overwhelmed Dutch player Max Warmerdam for his third victory on the trot and elevated himself to a joint lead after the seventh round of the Tata Steel Masters Chess tournament here on Sunday.

The victory helped Gujrathi move to joint fourth spot on four points along with compatriot R Praggnanandhaa and Alireza.

Praggnanadhaa played out a draw with Jorden Van Foreest of hosts, but Giri suffered a rare defeat at the hands of Abdusattarov.

Gukesh was surprised early in the opening if his clock was any indication. Warmerdam had come fully prepared in a Tarrasch defence in black as he blitzed the first thirty moves.

To Gukesh’s credit, he kept on trying to find the best resources even though the computers suggested that the resulting endgame with rooks and knights was just about equal.

Soon Warderman erred and ended up a pawn less in what was still a complicated endgame.

However, by this time, Gukesh had fully recovered and moves flowed showing some immaculate technique. It took 66 moves for a very satisfying victory.

Coming to the seventh round, Gujrathi had said his draws were obviously not part of the plan.

In the game against Alireza he took all the chances with white pieces.

Starting with the king pawn, Gujrathi faced the Sicilian Defence and Alireza sacrificed a piece early to initiate an attack against the white king.

As it turned out, it was not enough compensation for the sacrificed material as Gujrathi found a few correct moves to steer his king to safety. It was all over in 42 moves.

Praggnanadhaa could not make much use of his white pieces against Foreest out of a standard Queen’s gambit declined as the latter was well-prepared.

It was still a middle game when the players decided to sign peace.

In the challengers’ section, Leon Luke Mendonca improved his chances while defeating Stefan Beukema of Belgium while Divya Deshmukh scored over Liam Vrolijk of Netherlands.

The other Indian, D Harika played out a draw with Anton Korobov of Ukraine.

Masters Results (Round 7, Indians unless stated): Vidit Gujrathi (4) beat Firouzja, Alireza (Fra, 4); Wei Yi (Chn, 3.5) drew with Ding Liren (Chn, 3.5); Nodirbek Abdusattorov (4.5) beat Anish Giri (Ned, 4.5); Parham Maghsoodloo (Iri, 2) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 3.5); R Praggnanandhaa (4) drew with Jorden Van Foreest (Ned, 2.5); D Gukesh (4.5) beat Max Warmerdam (Ned, 3.5); Alexander Donchenko (Slo, 2) drew with Ju Wenjun (Chn 3).

Challengers: Divya Deshmukh (2.5) beat Vrolijk Liam (Ned, 3); Leon Luke Mendonca (4) beat Stefan Beukema (Bel, 2); D Harika (3) drew with Anton Korobov (Ukr, 4.5); Erwin L’Ami (Ned, 4.5) lost to Jaime Santos Latasa (Esp, 4); Daniel Dardha (Bel, 3.5) drew with Hans Moke Niemann (Usa, 3.5); Marc Andria Maurizzi (Fra, 4.5) drew with Mustafa Yilmaz (Tur, 3) Eline Roebers (Ned, 2) lost to A.R.

Colombo, Jan 21 (PTI) Sri Lanka’s main Tamil minority party – the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) – on Sunday elected Sivagnanam Sritharan its new leader through a secret ballot held at the eastern port district of Trincomalee.

The TNA in 2004 became the configuration of ITAK with five parties joining it. Currently, the TNA, which contested under the ITAK symbol in the last parliamentary election in 2020, holds 10 seats in the 225-member national parliament.

TNA was accused as the proxy of the then dominant LTTE which ran a parallel administration in the parts of North and East until they were crushed by the government troops in 2009 after a three decades-old campaign to carve out a separate Tamil state.

The leadership of ITAK had fallen vacant after the two-year term of its senior Mavai Senathirajah ended.

Pathak works in Lucknow and he had made up his mind that he would be in Ayodhya on January 22. “I was mentally prepared to walk down to Ayodhya in case I did not get any bus or any other vehicle. However, by the grace of Prabhu Shri Ram, I got a bus and I arrived in Ayodhya on Friday itself,” he said, and added that he is falling short of words to express himself.

“When the Babri mosque was razed, I was two years old. My mother used to take me to the Ram temple. Now, after January 22 ceremony, I will take my mother to the newly-constructed Ram temple,” Pathak added.

Expressing happiness over the upcoming consecration ceremony, Ayodhya-based homoeopathy doctor Dr Indroneel Banerjee told PTI, “It is such a moment for the people of Ayodhya which can never be forgotten. The people here have waited for this day for the past few generations. Ayodhya has the potential to become the spiritual capital of the country. After being sidelined for years together, I think Ayodhya’s time has come. Having been overlooked by successive governments, the people of Ayodhya have seen difficult days. Now, it is our time under the Sun right now.” Another resident, Prajjwal Singh, said, “We are standing on the threshold of history. We are eager to be an integral part of the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ celebrations of Ram Lalla. It is certainly a historic moment for us and for our generation, as we have seen our ancestors facing hardships. The tears, sweat, toil and the sacrifices they have made are being reaped by us today.” He added that his family members, relatives, friends and neighbours are also deeply engrossed in the celebrations which are likely to go on till the month-end.

Mahendra Shukla, a Samajwadi Party corporator, said all the people of Ayodhya are feeling happy. Everybody is going out of the way to help the visitors so that they do not face any problems here and go with pleasant memories, he added.

Atul Kumar, a resident of Naya Ghat area of Ayodhya, said January 22 is going to be a historic day not only for Ayodhya or Uttar Pradesh but also for the country, for the world and for the entire humanity.

Terming the ceremony as the “first phase of Ram rajya”, Saurabh Mishra said, “After the ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony, the entire world is going to embrace Lord Ram. It will be soaked in devotion of Prabhu Shri Ram.

Echoing similar sentiments, Anvesh Mishra, who runs a guest house, said, “This is going to the biggest event in the history of Ayodhya so far. Certainly, this will be a ‘Tryst with Divinity’ moment for me, for my family members and for entire Ayodhya residents. This is my luck that I am able to witness the history unfolding before my own eyes and that I am a resident of Ayodhya, where the special event is taking place. We are going to treasure this moment for the rest of our lives.” The much-awaited Ram temple consecration will be held here on Monday in a grand ceremony with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the rituals, following which the shrine will be opened for the public a day later.

The ‘Pran Pratishtha’ ceremony will begin at 12.20 pm and is expected to end by 1 pm. The prime minister will then address a gathering of more than 7,000 people, including seers and prominent personalities, at the venue.

Lakhs of people are expected to watch the event live on TV and online platforms as the BJP-ruled states and Odisha have declared a holiday while the central government has announced a half-day off.

As authorities made final preparations in a decked up Ayodhya, considered the birthplace of Lord Ram, temples across the country and abroad have announced special festivities to mark the occasion. PTI NAV KSS KSS SKY SKY

Islamabad [Pakistan], January 21 (ANI): Pakistan needs to restore the confidence of ordinary citizens in its legal and judicial landscape as it faces many challenges, including outdated legal frameworks, lack of capacity, and resource constraints.

Reports of law enforcement agencies indiscriminately killing innocent civilians continue across Pakistan, revealing an entrenched culture of violence enabled by flawed political, social, and justice systems, according to Dawn.

This denial marked a crucial step in rebuilding citizens’ trust in the justice system. Similar incidents, such as the 2020 arrest of a Frontier Corps soldier for the killing of a university student in Turbat, is another example of the struggle for justice for a common Pakistani, the report added.

The subsequent awarding of the Sitara-i-Shujaat to a police officer implicated in the Sahiwal tragedy added to the irony. These cases shed light on power dynamics, illustrating how officials in law-enforcement agencies misuse their authority, both high-ranking and low-ranking, and how the system often shields them from accountability.

Sarfraz Shah’s case stands out as a rare example of justice served, propelled by a captured incident on camera where Rangers killed a 22-year-old man in a public park in Karachi.

The emergence of social media activism and vigilant citizenry played a pivotal role in securing justice for the victim’s family, showcasing the potential of civil society in demanding accountability, as reported by Dawn.

In contrast, the Naqibullah murder case’s outcome, where Rao Anwar was acquitted, underscored the challenges in addressing extrajudicial practices. The Sahiwal tragedy, where the Counter Terrorism Department mistakenly killed a family, resulting in all accused officials being acquitted, further exposed the flaws in the system.

The judicial systemic issues persist. The lower ranks often bear the brunt of accountability in police brutality cases, serving as scapegoats to appease public anger while maintaining impunity for higher-ranking officials.

The reluctance of state institutions to engage with families of missing persons in Balochistan, currently protesting in Islamabad, highlights the challenges. A lack of dialogue and understanding perpetuates the issue, and the state’s counterproductive tactics exacerbate tensions.

The missing persons’ movement, initially focused on the rule of law, has been framed as a potential threat, reminiscent of the PTM, creating a narrative that poses challenges to the status quo.

The transformation of rights movements into political forces, exemplified by the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, emphasises the necessity for justice. The judiciary plays a crucial role in preventing law enforcement agencies from abusing their power in confrontational situations.

The charged atmosphere of protests demands a nuanced approach to addressing concerns, fostering dialogue instead of coercive measures, Dawn reported. (ANI)

Many were seen taking a picture of the ‘Deewaar’ actor.

Mumbai(Maharashtra) [India], January 21 (ANI): This Sunday also became special for the fans of megastar Amitabh Bachchan. He stepped out and met his admirers who gathered outside his bungalow, ‘Jalsa’ in Mumbai.

For his Sunday darshan, he opted for a white kurta that he paired with a shawl.

Every Sunday, hundreds of fans gather outside Amitabh Bachchan’s residence to get a glimpse of the megastar, and from the past over 40 years, the ‘Sholay’ star has been making sure to meet them.

In his blog, he had earlier shared that he always takes off his shoes before meeting his fans, describing it as a “devotion” for him to interact with his well-wishers.

He wrote, “I do observe though that the numbers are in lesser magnitude and the enthusiasm has lessened and the screams of joy now transferred to the mobile camera .. and that is more evident now an indication that time has moved on and nothing lasts forever.”

Meanwhile, on the work front, Big B will be next seen in the sci-fi action thriller film ‘Kalki 2898 AD’ alongside Deepika Padukone and Prabhas.

He also has a courtroom drama film ‘Section 84’ in his kitty. (ANI)
